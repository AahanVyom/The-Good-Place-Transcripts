I'm Michael.\n\nHow are you today?\n\nI'm great.\n\nThanks for asking.\n\nOh, one question.\n\nWhere am I? Who are you? And what's going on?\n\nRight, so, you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.\n\nYour life on Earth has ended, and you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe.\n\nCool.\n\nCool. I have some questions.\n\nThought you might. [chuckles]\n\nHow did I die?\n\nI-I don't remember.\n\nYes, um, in cases of traumatic or embarrassing deaths, we erase the memory to allow for a peaceful transition.\n\nAre you sure you want to hear?\n\nAll right, so you were in a grocery store parking lot.\n\nYou dropped a bottle of something called \"Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One.\"\n\nAnd when you bent down to pick it up, a long column of shopping carts that were being returned to the shopping cart collection area rolled out of control and plowed right into you.\n\nOof.\n\nThat's how I died?\n\nNo, sorry, there's more.\n\nYou were able to grab on to the front of the column of shopping carts, but it swept you right out into the street where you were struck and k*lled by a mobile billboard truck advertising an erectile dysfunction pill called \"Engorge-ulate.\"\n\nFunnily enough, the first EMT to arrive was an ex-boyfriend of yours...\n\nOkay, that's... I get it, thank you.\n\nOh, okay, sorry.\n\nUm, so who was right?\n\nI mean about all of this?\n\nWell, let's see. Hindus are a little bit right, Muslims a little bit.\n\nJews, Christians, Buddhists, every religion guessed about 5%, except for Doug Forcett.\n\nWho... who's Doug Forcett?\n\nWell, Doug was a stoner kid who lived in Calgary during the 1970s.\n\nOne night, he got really high on mushrooms, and his best friend, Randy, said, \"Hey, what do you think happens after we die?\"\n\n\n\nAnd Doug just launched into this long monologue where he got like 92% correct. [chuckles]\n\nI mean, we couldn't believe what we were hearing.\n\nThat's him, actually, right up there.\n\nHe's pretty famous around here.\n\nI'm very lucky to have that.\n\nSo...\n\n[chuckles]\n\nMaybe my biggest question: am I... I mean, is this...\n\nOr...\n\nWell, it's not the heaven or hell idea that you were raised on.\n\nBut generally speaking, in the afterlife, there's a Good Place and there's a Bad Place.\n\nYou're in the Good Place.\n\n[exhales sharply]\n\nYou're okay, Eleanor.\n\nYou're in the Good Place.\n\nWell, that's good.\n\nSure is. [laughs]\n\nOkay, let's take a walk, shall we?\n\nOh, did I have a purse?\n\nNo, I'm dead, right. Okay.\n\nSo this is how it works.\n\nThe Good Place is divided into distinct neighborhoods.\n\nEach one contains exactly 322 people who have been perfectly selected to blend together into a blissful harmonic balance.\n\nDo all the neighborhoods look like this?\n\nNo, every neighborhood is unique.\n\nSome have warm weather, some cold.\n\nSome are cities, some farmland.\n\nBut in each one, every blade of grass, every ladybug, every detail has been precisely designed and calibrated for its residents.\n\nThere's a lot of frozen yogurt places.\n\nYeah. [sighs]\n\nThat's the one thing we put in all the neighborhoods.\n\nPeople love frozen yogurt.\n\nI don't know what to tell you.\n\nYou're gonna have a million more questions, I know.\n\nFor right now, better grab a seat.\n\nMovie's about to begin.\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\nAh. [chuckles] Hello, everyone.\n\nAnd welcome to your first day in the afterlife.\n\nYou were all, simply put, good people.\n\nBut how do we know that you were good?\n\nHow are we sure?\n\nDuring your time on Earth,\n\nevery one of your actions had a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe.\n\nEvery sandwich you ate,\n\nevery time you bought a magazine,\n\nevery single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad.\n\nYou know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic?\n\nAnd they think to themselves, \"Ah, who cares? No one's watching.\"\n\nWe were watching.\n\nSurprise.\n\n[laughter]\n\nAnyway, when your time on Earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system.\n\nOnly the people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop, get to come here, to the Good Place.\n\nWhat happens to everyone else, you ask?\n\nDon't worry about it.\n\nThe point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived.\n\nAnd you won't be alone.\n\nYour true soul mate is here too.\n\n[crowd gasps and murmurs]\n\nThat's right.\n\nSoul mates are real.\n\nOne of the other people in your neighborhood is your actual soul mate,\xa0and you will spend eternity together.\n\nSo welcome to eternal happiness.\n\nWelcome to the Good Place.\n\nSponsored by:\n\notters holding hands while they sleep.\n\nYou know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands?\n\nThat's how you're gonna feel every day.\n\n[applause]\n\nSo who is in the Bad Place, that would shock me?\n\nUh, well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis, basically every artist ever, uh, every U.S. president except Lincoln.\n\nThat sounds about right.\n\nWhat about Florence Nightingale?\n\nThat was close, but, no, she didn't make it.\n\nWow, all those amazing people down there, it just seems so hard to believe.\n\nAgain, it's an incredibly selective system.\n\nMost people don't make it here.\n\nBut you, a lawyer who got innocent people off death row, you're special, Eleanor.\n\nAnd by the way, welcome to your new home.\n\nOh, it's perfect, isn't it?\n\nYou see, in the Good Place, every person gets to live in a home that perfectly matches his or her true essence.\n\nCool.\n\nSo I guess that's why my house, for example, is this adorable little cottage, whereas other people might have homes that are bigger, like that one.\n\nExactly.\n\nOh, I'm so happy you get it.\n\nAs you can see, the interior has been decorated just as you like it, in the Icelandic primitive style.\n\nOh, oh, and, uh, of course, you love clowns, so...\n\nI do love clowns.\n\nNow, let me show you the, uh... the video system here.\n\n[shimmering tone]\n\nYou can review everything that happened in your life from your point of view.\n\nThere we go.\n\nThis is your Human Rights mission to the Ukraine.\n\nI mean, you got a ton of points for that one.\n\nIt really put you over the top.\n\nOh.\n\nChidi, come on in.\n\nEleanor?\n\nI'm Chidi Anagonye, and you are my soul mate.\n\nCool, bring it in, man.\n\nNow, excuse me.\n\nI have other people to attend to.\n\nSo where you from, Chidi?\n\nWell, I was born in Nigeria, raised in Senegal, but my work took me all over the place...\n\nAustralia, Hong Kong, Paris.\n\nWhat about you?\n\nUh, well, I... I was born in Phoenix.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nArizona.\n\nAnd then I went to school in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nAnd then I moved back to Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nYour English is amazing.\n\nOh!\n\nI'm actually speaking French.\n\nThis place just translates whatever you say into a language the other person can understand.\n\nSo it's incredible.\n\nWhoa.\n\nAnd now I want to say this.\n\nMm-kay.\n\nEleanor.\n\nI have spent my entire life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the universe.\n\nAnd now we can actually learn about them together as soul mates.\n\nIt's overwhelming.\n\nChidi.\n\nYou'll stand by my side no matter what, right?\n\nOf course I will.\n\nPromise me. Say, \"I promise I will never betray you for any reason.\"\n\nEleanor, I swear that I will never say or do anything to cause you any harm.\n\nGood.\n\nBecause those aren't my memories.\n\nI wasn't a lawyer. I never went to the Ukraine.\n\nI hate clowns.\n\nThere's been a big mistake.\n\nI'm not supposed to be here.\n\nWait, what?\n\n[light instrumental music]\n\n\u266a\n\n[children chattering]\n\nAre you sure this isn't you?\n\nYeah, man, I'm pretty sure I wasn't a death row lawyer who collected clown paintings and rescued orphans.\n\nThey got my name right, but nothing else.\n\nI mean, somebody royally forked up.\n\nSomebody forked up.\n\nWhy can't I say \"fork\"?\n\nIf you're trying to curse, you can't here.\n\nI guess a lot of people in this neighborhood don't like it, so it's prohibited.\n\nThat's bullshirt.\n\nSo, uh, if you're not this person, then who are you?\n\nWhat did you do for a living?\n\nI was... in... sales.\n\nSo we sell two products here, NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver.\n\nWe aim this at seniors.\n\nNow, you can't legally call it medicine because it doesn't technically work and it is technically chalk, so what you're gonna want to do...\n\nYou need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake medicine.\n\nI get it, man. Which one's my desk?\n\nSo your job was to defraud the elderly?\n\nSorry... the sick and elderly?\n\nBut I was very good at it.\n\nI was the top salesperson five years running.\n\nOkay, but that's worse.\n\nI mean, you... you do get how that's worse?\n\nRight?\n\nMm.\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\nYou know, maybe... it's a test.\n\nMaybe if you go to Michael and you tell him the truth, you'll pass the test and you'll get to stay.\n\nNo way.\n\nI can't risk going to the Bad Place.\n\nOkay, well, maybe it's not actually, like, all that bad.\n\nLet's just get some information first.\n\nWe'll ask Janet. Hey, Janet?\n\nHi there.\n\nGah!\n\nHow can I help you?\n\nWhat the fork? Who are you?\n\nI'm Janet.\n\nI'm the informational assistant here in the Good Place.\n\nShe's like this walking database.\n\nYou can ask her about the creation of the universe or history...\n\nOh, there was a guy who lived in Avondale, Arizona, around 2002.\n\nHis name was Kevin Paltonic.\n\nIs he gay?\n\nNo.\n\nReally? Huh.\n\nI guess he just didn't want to have sex with me.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nWell, that's fine, I wasn't that into him anyway.\n\nYes, you were.\n\nOkay, Janet, I have a question.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhat is the Bad Place like?\n\nOh, sorry, that is the one topic I'm not allowed to tell you about.\n\nI can only play you a brief audio clip of what is happening there right now.\n\nOkay.\n\n[people yelling and screaming,\xa0mechanical buzzing]\n\nThe bear has two mouths!\n\n[people screaming]\n\n[sound stops]\n\nWell, it doesn't sound awesome.\n\n[scoffs]\n\nDoes everyone have a huge house except me?\n\nAll right, we need a plan.\n\nI say we just lie low and hope that they don't notice me.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't think I can help you.\n\nI just don't like being dishonest, and I can't advise you to be dishonest either.\n\nCome on, I'm just asking you to fudge a little bit.\n\nYou must've told a few white lies in your life.\n\nI mean, what was your job?\n\nI was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.\n\nMotherforker!\n\nI'm getting a stomachache.\n\nI'm in a perfect utopia, and I'm... I have a stomachache.\n\nThis is awful.\n\nI-I, uh... I think I have to tell Michael about this.\n\nTell Michael about what?\n\nMichael? Hi.\n\nWhat have you been up to?\n\nEleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu.\n\nThey are soul mates and your next-door neighbors.\n\nHello.\n\nCan I just say I love your house?\n\nIt's just so tiny and cute.\n\nIt's like a little child's plaything, like for a family of mice or for a very fancy little dog.\n\nI love it. It's just so sweet and teensy.\n\nJust like you. Boop.\n\nOh.\n\nOh.\n\nYou booped me. Ha-ha.\n\nI did.\n\nThat's fun.\n\nTahani and Jianyu are having a little welcome party tonight, and they've invited the entire neighborhood.\n\n[squeaks]\n\nI simply adore entertaining.\n\nDon't I just adore it, Jianyu?\n\nOh, um, yes, by the way, Jianyu here is a Buddhist monk, you see?\n\nAnd he obeys a strict code of silence.\n\nSo when you see him smiling and nodding, that's actually his way of jumping up and down with glee.\n\nIsn't that right, darling?\n\nSo we'll see you tonight?\n\nGreat.\n\nYes.\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\n[scoffs]\n\nNo way.\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\nMy entire house could fit in this room.\n\nOkay, uh... help me out here.\n\nTell me one good thing that you did on Earth, just one truly kind and decent act so that I can feel better about helping you out.\n\nLet's forget about good.\n\nUm, just tell me something neutral about yourself.\n\nLike, tell me about the day before you died.\n\nWhat do you remember?\n\nHi there.\n\nDo you have a second to talk about the environment?\n\nDo you have a second to eat my farts?\n\nYou missed.\n\n[scoffs] Pick it up if you're so horny for the environment.\n\nI don't remember anything specific.\n\nOh.\n\nLook.\n\nI might not have been a saint, but it's not like I k*lled anybody.\n\nI wasn't an arsonist.\n\nI never found a wallet outside of an IHOP and thought about returning it but saw the owner lived out of state so just took the cash and dropped the wallet back on the ground.\n\nOkay, that's really specific, and that makes me think that you definitely did do that.\n\nAll I'm saying is these people might be \"good,\" but are they really that much better than me?\n\n\n\nWell, I spent half my life in North Korea fighting for women's rights and the other half in Saudi Arabia fighting for gay rights.\n\n\n\nSo we said, \"If the U.N. won't remove those land mines, we will.\"\n\nAnd we dug up over a thousand unexploded land mines from the area surrounding the orphanage.\n\nWell, then he said, \"You can't give me both your kidneys; you'll die.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"But you will live.\"\n\nAnd I know we just met on this bus ten minutes ago, but he seemed nice.\n\n[groans] Oh, forget it. Heading to the bar!\n\n[glass clinking]\n\n[polite applause]\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nYou all know that I am the architect of this neighborhood.\n\nBut what you don't know is...\n\nGolly, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, um, oh, what the heck?\n\nThis is actually the very first neighborhood that I have ever designed.\n\nI had been an apprentice for over 200 years, and my boss has finally given me my first solo project.\n\n[murmurs and applause]\n\nYes!\n\n[laughs]\n\nAh, gah-gah... gah-gah-gah. Hold on there, ace.\n\nLet me get more of them shrampies.\n\nOkay, easy.\n\nWhat?\n\nThey're for everybody, right?\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nAnd you deserve a perfect world because every single one of you is a good person.\n\nThat's it for me. Back to you, Tahani.\n\nBravo, Michael, bravo!\n\nThank you.\n\nUm, and I would just like to quickly say if any of you would like to play tennis tonight, we have 36 regulation grass tennis courts.\n\nSuch fun. Cheers. [laughs]\n\n[applause]\n\nTahani, what a condescending bench.\n\nOkay, okay, okay, okay.\n\nAm I right?\n\nWhy does she still have that British accent, right?\n\nNo one else here has an accent.\n\nShe's choosing to have that accent.\n\nShh-shh-shh-shh.\n\n[stodgily] \"Oh, hello.\n\n\"I am just a big, beautiful, utterly perfect cartoon giraffe.\"\n\nOh, okay. Okay.\n\nI think it's time to go home.\n\n[laughing mockingly]\n\nWait, wait, wait. I just have to go upstairs real quick and steal a bunch of gold stuff.\n\nOkay, don't do that.\n\nDon't do... no, Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor.\n\n[light instrumental music]\n\nHello, creepy house that I hate.\n\nHello, one million clowns.\n\nWhy aren't there stairs here?\n\n\u266a\n\n[groans]\n\nWhat kind of weirdo house is this?\n\nOoh.\n\nDid you fill your bra with shrimp?\n\nNo.\n\n[hiccups]\n\nYes.\n\nWhatever, it's freakin' heaven.\n\nI'm sure they have plenty of shellfish.\n\nThat Tahani is a real butthead, huh?\n\n[gasps] Hey.\n\nAt least I can still say \"butthead.\"\n\n[groans] She is a butthead.\n\nFound some pajamas.\n\nChidi... Chidi, Chidi?\n\nI'm sorry that you had to deal with this...\n\nIt's okay.\n\nIt's not, though.\n\n[sighs]\n\nDo you think anybody cared that I died?\n\nMaybe someone did.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI was an only child.\n\nMy parents were divorced when I was a kid.\n\nThey were both crummy people, so they're probably...

Where's the beef?\n\n[chuckles]\n\nI don't know.\n\nHump day.\n\n[knocking]\n\nHello, Eleanor.\n\nJianyu, darling, look, it's Eleanor from next door.\n\nIs he asleep?\n\nYeah, there's really no way to tell.\n\nCome on in.\n\nWhat brings you to our home, my dear?\n\nWell, I'm simply repaying your kind gift with a housewarming gift of my own.\n\nFresh pears.\n\nIt's a plant, just like your gift, but you can actually eat them.\n\nSo maybe it's a better gift.\n\nWho's to say?\n\nThat's so kind.\n\nHowever, in, um, Chinese culture, pears are actually a symbol of bad luck.\n\nAnd... and I wouldn't want to offend Jianyu, so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to throw these in the garbage.\n\nBut do come and sit down.\n\nWe haven't even had a chance\n\nto discuss all of the mayhem in our neighborhood yet.\n\nIt's so disconcerting.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat do you think is causing it?\n\nOh, I'm sure I don't know.\n\nBut we must keep our heads up.\n\nIn fact, tomorrow I'm actually going door-to-door to make sure that every single person in this entire neighborhood is keeping calm and carrying on.\n\n'Cause I think that helping others will make me feel like I truly belong here, you know?\n\nHere's a brainstorm, why don't I go with you?\n\nI mean, I would love to do my part to help the neighborhood, not to mention, get a little bonding time with you, lady.\n\nOh, hurrah!\n\nSuch fun.\n\nI'm telling you, Tahani's out to get me.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nThis note was slipped under my door yesterday.\n\nIt has to be Tahani.\n\nShe just said to me, \"I want to feel like I truly belong here.\"\n\nWell, where have I seen the word \"belong\" recently?\n\nOh yeah,\xa0kaplow!\n\nI really don't think she's the type of person who would write this.\n\nShe is that kind of person and she did write it.\n\nShe wants everybody to think she's such a perfect princess just 'cause she's tall and glamorous and has cappuccino skin and curves everywhere... and now I'm complimenting her.\n\nAnd kind of turned on.\n\nThe point is, she straight up sucks, bro.\n\n[chiming]\n\nWhoa.\n\nTypical Tahani.\n\nBrings us a faulty plant so she can brag about being a better gardener.\n\nNo, I think this is another way in which your negative actions affect this world.\n\n\n\nThis plant represents your relationship to Tahani, so when you're mean to her, it starts to wilt.\n\n\n\nWell, then this plant is doomed, because tomorrow, I'm going with her and I'm gonna prove to you and to everyone that she is secretly a two-faced, calculating, phony bench.\n\n[weeping]\n\nHmm. Yeah.\n\nTruth hurts, doesn't it, plant?\n\nSo all I want to do is just check in, see how everyone's holding up.\n\nJust bring some cheer to these extraordinary people.\n\nCool.\n\nSo tell me about yourself.\n\nI mean, I want to hear it all, girlfriend.\n\nThe good, the bad, the really bad, the embarrassing, the humiliating, just... let's bond!\n\nOkay, well I was born in Pakistan, raised in London, schooled in Paris, but I think the primary reason that I'm in the Good Place is that I raised quite a lot of money for non-profit groups.\n\nOh.\n\nDid you ever, uh, skim a little off the top for yourself?\n\nGracious, no, no!\n\nEvery penny was accounted for.\n\nAnd as I raised nearly $60 billion, there was quite a lot of pennies.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nBut I also dabbled in some other professions.\n\nI was a model, a museum curator, an \"It Girl,\" and... oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's muse for a while.\n\nThat was quite fun.\n\nModeling? That's a crazy life.\n\nWant to tell me about that rock bottom you probably hit?\n\nOh, I didn't really do it for long.\n\nCouture just doesn't fit my body.\n\nI'm cursed with ample bosom.\n\nAnd yet you soldier on.\n\nOh, this is silly... so \"Tahani\" means \"congratulations\" in Arabic.\n\nAnd \"Al-Jamil\" means \"beautiful,\"\n\nso my full name altogether means...\n\n\"Congratulations, Beautiful.\"\n\nThanks, Eleanor. You big flirt.\n\n[giggles]\n\nHey, babe, got you coffee.\n\nOh, great.\n\nOh, Andy's Coffee, uh, we shouldn't go there.\n\nEverybody's boycotting.\n\nYeah, I know that one guy found a scorpion in his latte.\n\nI don't really care, though, 'cause it's so close to here.\n\n\n\nNo, no, no, it's because he's sexually harassing people.\n\nLook, a journalist went undercover for an interview and recorded him.\n\nHere,\xa0\xa0watch.\n\nHere's the thing, sweetheart.\n\nYou're very qualified, but you're also what we call in the coffee shop game a, uh, \"dog-face.\"\n\nYou're a three, and you have to be a nine to work here.\n\nIt's just math.\n\nSo I didn't get the job?\n\n[chuckles]\n\nNo, dog-face, you didn't get the job.\n\nAll right, I'll check your references.\n\nJust to be nice...\n\nHey, my breasts!\n\nI'll check 'em. Oh, they're good. Honk!\n\n\n\nI mean, this guy's a monster, we can't support this guy.\n\nOkay, hey, you're not better than me just 'cause you won't support a guy who grabbed a boob once.\n\nNo, I'm just saying we shouldn't go there.\n\nWe can get coffee somewhere else.\n\nDid you know your left reference is a little bit bigger than your right reference?\n\nIt's not a bad thing, it's just... it's a thing.\n\nThis is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi.\n\nCartography.\n\nYour neighborhood stretches way beyond what you've already seen.\n\nAnd you can map it, revealing all of the mysteries, like an explorer.\n\nI see how that might be fun.\n\nUh, but, uh, exploring makes me nervous.\n\nI have what doctor's call \"directional insanity.\"\n\nI once got lost on an escalator.\n\nSo not exactly Christopher Columbus.\n\nFun fact: Columbus is in the Bad Place because of all the raping, sl*ve trade, and genocide.\n\nThe fact that it makes you nervous is exactly why you should do it.\n\nYou know, get out of your comfort zone.\n\nBecome a trail-blazer.\n\nFun fact: all deceased members of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team are also in the Bad Place.\n\n[giggles]\n\nYeah, sorry about this.\n\nI steered her away from colloquialisms and into \"fun facts\" and trivia tidbits.\n\nI thought it'd be more in her wheelhouse.\n\nFun fact: a \"wheelhouse\" is a part of a boat.\n\nOkay, thank you, Janet, thank you.\n\nFun fact: Janet is me.\n\nAll right, let's forget about exploring.\n\nPlenty more ideas for hobbies.\n\nLet's walk back to town, shall we?\n\nWrong way.\n\nYep.\n\nWell, Glenn, we just wanted to make sure you were all right.\n\nTahani, you're too sweet.\n\nIsn't she just the nicest person?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nThat is what a lot of people are saying.\n\nOh, everyone I know is saying that.\n\nYeah, it's just a big neighborhood full of enormous mansions and people who love Tahani!\n\n[both laughing]\n\nEleanor and I just want to see if there's anything we can do to help you.\n\nOh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful.\n\nDespite all the chaos earlier, we simply couldn't be happier.\n\nOh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli.\n\nPlease take a maple butter scone.\n\nI made them fresh this morning.\n\nOh, they look a bit burned.\n\nBut they're not.\n\nHmm. Oh, fork, that's good.\n\nExtra, extra!\n\nRead all about you.\n\nChidi, this is the perfect hobby for you.\n\nJournalism.\n\nWell, obviously, I like to write.\n\nBut I don't love deadlines.\n\nI prefer to take my time with things.\n\nYes, I know.\n\nUh, you never even named your dog, did you?\n\nWhen it ran away, you posted signs saying, \"responds to long pauses.\"\n\nLook, Chidi, I'm just trying to find you a hobby... the hat... that will bring you a positive experience.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nI'm loving that hat on you.\n\nIt would look even better on my floor.\n\nWhat is happening now?\n\nI suggested she be friendlier; she seems to have slipped right into overt sexuality.\n\nI got something you can slip into.\n\nOh...\n\nJanet, no!\n\nNo, Janet.\n\nOh, Jianyu, darling, would you like some tea?\n\nThat nod meant no, apparently.\n\nWell, it was nice to get out and meet all of our wonderful neighbors.\n\nThey all truly belong here.\n\nOh, yes they do, cutie-pants.\n\nBoop!\n\nWell, I should really be going. I have to begin my 12 step Korean skincare regiment, but, uh, I'll see... oh, no, no, no.\n\nPlease stay and enjoy the evening tea.\n\nI'll see you soon.\n\nBoop!\n\n\"The Diary of Tahani Al-Jamil.\"\n\nOkay. Arc welding.\n\nYou could learn sculpture, you can make furniture, you can get your hands a little greasy, you know, and you make things.\n\nThis equipment is very scary!\n\nDon't be a baby. It can't hurt you.\n\n\xa0Watch, I'll blowtorch your face off.\n\nJanet.\n\nWhatever.\n\nThis whole thing is stupid.\n\nOh, brother.\n\nI told her to be less flirty and now she's cruel and distant, apparently.\n\nI just can't get this right.\n\nThank you for trying to find me a new hobby.\n\nUm, but I just want to be an academic.\n\nI want to keep working on my manuscript.\n\nChidi, here's the thing... see, I read your whole book, all 3,600 pages of it.\n\nIt's, um... how shall I put this?\n\nIt's a mess, dude.\n\nHey!\n\nShe's right.\n\nYou see, Chidi, I can read the entirety of the world's literature in about an hour.\n\nThis took me two weeks to get through.\n\nI mean, it's so convoluted, I just kept reading the same paragraph over and over again, trying to figure out what the heck you were saying.\n\nOh, no.\n\nI mean, on page 1,000, you start section two with the sentence, \"Of course, the exact opposite might be true.\"\n\nYou're a brilliant guy, Chidi.\n\nBut you just kept revising and rewriting and adding words to your title.\n\nI think you just twisted yourself up into a knot.\n\nI have a very bad stomachache.\n\nHey, man.\n\n[door closes]\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nAm I a good teacher?\n\nAm I clear? Do I make sense?\n\nYeah, you're a great teacher.\n\nI'm super ethical now.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nHmm?\n\nNah... don't worry about it.\n\nI stole Tahani's diary.\n\nSo I could see if her handwriting matches the note and also read about all the mean and terrible things she's definitely done so I can prove she's actually evil.\n\n[fire crackling]\n\nHuh.\n\nWhat do you think that means?\n\nYou stole Tahani's diary.\n\nI know I broke some ethical rule, but I had good reason.\n\nEleanor, in order to be a good person, you have to do good things.\n\nAnd not stealing people's stuff, that is just a basic kindergarten rule.\n\n\n\nI mean, do I also have to tell you to not throw sand?\n\nFirst of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire.\n\nWhy would you even know that?\n\nSecond of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does.\n\nShe wrote that note.\n\nNo she didn't!\n\nYou did!\n\nI was hoping you would come to this conclusion on your own, but, obviously, no one here would ever thr*aten you.\n\nThat note is the Good Place manifesting your own guilt.\n\nLike with the plant, or when you literally made giant shrimp fly through the air.\n\nI wrote myself the note.\n\nAnd as it turns out, I do belong here.\n\nBecause I'm just as good as everyone else.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nNo, you don't belong here.\n\nAnd in this place, everyone is better than you.\n\nIt has been proven by an infallible formula.\n\nTahani might be a little British and condescending at times, but she devoted her entire life to helping other people.\n\nShe's a good person.\n\nAccept that.\n\nHey, babe.\n\nGreat news, I got us tickets to the Coyotes game.\n\nAwesome!\n\nBut, ooh, yikes.\n\nTurns out two of the players have DUIs.\n\nGuess we can't cheer for that team.\n\nEleanor, I...\n\nYou know what?\n\nInstead, let's just stay in,\xa0\xa0watch\xa0a Roman Polanski movie, listen to R. Kelly, and eat Chik-fil-A.\n\nDoes that sound good?\n\nThere's bad stuff everywhere, man.\n\nIt's impossible to avoid.\n\nYeah, but shouldn't we just try?\n\nShouldn't we just try to do the right thing whenever we can?\n\nWhy? It's so much harder to live like that.\n\nAnd it's not like someone's keeping score.\n\n[sighs]\n\nLook, I know you're gonna break up with me, okay?\n\nI'm not an idiot.\n\nI read your emails to your dad.\n\nHave fun being so amazing and perfect until you die.\n\nAnd by the way, I'm talking really fast because I still go to Andy's Coffee, and I got a full punch card, bro.\n\nGood people make me insecure.\n\nWhen I'm around someone who I think is better than me, I try and drag them down to my level.\n\nThat's why perfect Tahani is like my kryptonite.\n\nWell, even admitting that is an important step.\n\nAnd also, maybe don't listen to me.\n\nI would love not to listen to you.\n\nWait, what?\n\nBasically, my life's work is 3,600 pages of garbage.\n\nEven Michael couldn't understand it.\n\nSo?\n\nWhat does Michael know?\n\nEverything.\n\nThat's my point... he knows everything, and it was too convoluted, even for him.\n\nMichael does not know everything.\n\nMichael does not know I'm not supposed to be here.\n\nYou wrote 4,000 pages on one of the most complicated subjects in the world.\n\nI mean I used to get bored halfway through writing a text message.\n\nBe proud.\n\nI want to broaden my horizons\n\nand try new things, and I will.\n\nBut even though I might have gotten lost in the weeds, I loved writing this book.\n\nAnd I want to try again.\n\nSo... will you be my advisor?\n\nChidi, all I want is for you to be happy.\n\nSo if spending eternity getting blunt feedback on your circular, rambling ideas will make you happy, then of course I will be your advisor.\n\nLet's throw that monstrosity in the trash and start over.\n\nAren't there maybe some parts worth salvaging?\n\nHonestly, man, I don't even know.\n\nI mean, that thing is unreadable.\n\nI literally learned what headaches were because that thing gave me a headache.\n\nOkay.\n\nThere you go.\n\nNew beginnings! Well done.\n\n[crying]\n\n[gentle knocking]\n\nOh!\n\nOh, hello, Eleanor.

You do.\n\nEleanor, you don't know what it's like to be in paradise and feel like there's something just not quite right.\n\nWell...\n\nI may not know exactly what you're feeling, but I do understand.\n\nAnd you deserve to be happy, because... you are an impressive, thoughtful, and special person.\n\nNot to mention... you have a rockin' bod.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nI mean, Jianyu may be mute, but he's not blind.\n\n[laughs]\n\nYou two belong here.\n\nAnd you belong together.\n\nAnd you have all of eternity, so there's plenty of time for things to change.\n\nOh, thank you.\n\nI really needed to hear that. Come here.\n\nUgh, of course your hugs are amazing.\n\n[yawns]\n\n[yelps]\n\nStupid ledge.\n\nUgh, stairs.\n\nEveryone here is really into hugging.\n\nLooks like someone learned something.\n\nWell, it's 'cause someone else is a really good teacher.\n\nEleanor, hello.\n\nHow are you, my dear, sweet bestie?\n\nNever better. What's up?\n\nWell, Janet has been acting as my assistant.\n\nIt's not what she was designed to do.\n\nDidn't go great.\n\nBut now I'm back to normal.\n\nIt turns out that the best Janet was the Janet that was inside Janet all along.\n\nShe was feeling a little lost, so I gave her a self-help book to restore her confidence.\n\nNow I'm living my truth and creating my bliss.\n\nAnyway, um, look, Michael asked me if I would serve as his assistant, but I'd quite like to focus on my relationship with Jianyu.\n\nSo I recommended you for the job.\n\n[giggles]\n\nEleanor, you and I could work side-by-side to figure out what's going wrong with this neighborhood.\n\nWill you help me?\n\nHow could I say no?\n\nYeah, hurrah!\n\nHurrah!\n\n[giggles]\n\nWhat now?\n\n[sighs]\n\nRelax, Eleanor.\n\nYou sent this to yourself.\n\nThis is your own guilt manifesting itself.\n\nI've been waiting for you.\n\nJianyu?\n\nYou talk now?\n\nYou sent me these threatening notes?\n\nWhat the fork, man?\n\nSome Buddhist monk you are.\n\nYou don't belong here.\n\nAdmit it.\n\nOkay, you're right.\n\nI don't belong here.\n\nMichael made a mistake.\n\nBut I'm trying, dude.\n\nI'm really trying to be a good person.\n\nAnd I think I'm changing for the better, so just please, please don't rat me out.\n\nDon't worry, I won't.\n\n[sighs]\n\nBecause I'm not supposed to be here, either.\n\nI don't know how I got here, I have no idea what's going on, and I am freakin' out, homey!\n\nYou got to help me.\n\nI'm scared!\n\nWhat?\n    ]"},{number:4,title:"Jason Mendoza",summary:"Eleanor Shellstrop arrives in the Good Place and meets her soulmate Chidi...",transcript:"[Hang on, hang on...

I'm Michael.\n\nBefore we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk and kept a vow of silence.\n\nWould you prefer to remain silent here as well?\n\nYou literally haven't said a word since we got here?\n\nYeah.

Got to give it up.\n\nOkay, I need to make sure that this isn't some sort of weird trap.\n\nIs your real name Jianyu?\n\nNo. It's Jason Mendoza.\n\nAnd by the way, everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese.\n\nI'm Filipino. That's r*cist.\n\nHeaven is so r*cist.\n\nBut Tahani said that you helped Michael by putting your hand on his chest and doing some sort of healing magic.\n\nYeah. A nurse did that to calm me down once when I crashed my Jet Ski into a manatee.\n\nYou crashed your Jet Ski into a manatee?\n\nYeah. I'm from Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nIt happens a lot.\n\nWhat did you do for a living?\n\nI was an amateur DJ specializing in EDM.\n\nElectronic dance music.\n\nI was also an amateur hip-hop backup dancer, an amateur body spray inventor... um, I did pranks on Vine.\n\nNone of those are jobs.\n\nWhat did you do to make money?\n\nOh, I sold fake dr*gs to college kids.\n\nOkay, good.\n\nOkay, here's my biggest question: how did you know that I didn't belong here?\n\nI figured it out the very first night, at the party, using my powers of deduction.\n\nI heard you don't talk.\n\nWell, here's something for you to not talk about.\n\nI don't belong here.\n\n[laughs]\n\nThey made a mistake.\n\nTotal phony.\n\nSo, shh!\n\nOkay, later, man.\n\nOkay.

I was done.\n\nWell, good, because of course I will.\n\nJanet?\n\nHey, there.\n\nOh, hello, darling.\n\nI would like to model tonight's event on my most successful gala.\n\nThat would be 2006 fundraiser for stem cell research in Barcelona.\n\n\"Barthelona,\" actually.\n\nOh, it was a perfect evening.\n\nPrincess Stephanie was there, as were Posh and Becks.\n\nYou know, \"International Sophisticate Magazine\" gave us five Gwyneths.\n\n[giggles]\n\nTonight, I'm going to select my jauntiest suit, and I may even wear suspenders.\n\nIt's one of the human clothing items I'm most eager to try.\n\nOh, well, good luck.\n\nThank you. Yes, yes.\n\nI'm excited.\n\nAnd a little nervous.\n\nI'd say that I'm cautiously optimistic.\n\n[laughing] I hope I don't chicken out at the last second.\n\nSorry... we are talking about suspenders, right?\n\nLike... these?\n\nYou can do that with... oh! [laughs]\n\nI cannot wait.\n\nExcellent.\n\nSo, Tahani has no idea about me?\n\nNo. She thinks I'm a monk, and she thinks you're her best friend.\n\nGreat. I mean, for us.\n\nIt's a huge bummer for her.\n\nWe need someplace that we can talk in private.\n\nI agree.\n\nLet me show you my bud-hole.\n\nWhat?\n\nI should warn you: it's a little messy.\n\nThis is my bud-hole.\n\nIt's just, like, a hole where me and my buds can hang out.\n\nOh,\xa0bud-hole!\n\nOkay, now I get it.\n\nI wrote down on a piece of paper that I needed a private meditation area.\n\nTahani will never come in.\n\nPretty unique decorating style you have here, Jianyu.\n\nIt's like, \"12-year-old boy\" meets \"13-year-old boy.\"\n\nThanks. Janet helped me get all this stuff.\n\nShe rules.\n\nIs she single, or is she married to Michael?\n\nNo, no, dude, you cannot date Janet.\n\nA: she's not human.

I have a class to get to.\n\nWha... a class?\n\nI didn't know there were classes.\n\nChidi is trying to teach me to be a good person.\n\nAnd it's really hard.\n\nAlso, Michael has asked me to be his assistant, whatever that means.\n\nMy whole situation here is getting more and more dicey, so I'm actually really glad to have a place I can come when I just want to be myself.\n\nYeah. I miss being myself.\n\nMyself was the best.\n\n[crowd shouting]\n\n[EDM music playing]\n\nWhoo! Whoo!\n\nWhat's up, man? You're Jason?\n\nYou got two minutes. Fred Durst is throwing an orgy on a partially capsized yacht.\n\nMy dad just texted. It already started.\n\nSo I'll get right to the point.\n\nI listened to your demo. You're terrible.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay? You just don't have any... what's the word?\n\nTalent.\n\nBut don't worry. You got something better than talent, man.\n\nYou got my approximate size and weight.\n\nI'm supposed to play this club for the rest of the week, but I just got an offer to DJ Scott Disick's after party for the Amateur Porn Awards in Reno.\n\nWhoa!

I should've warned you.\n\nPatricia is actually very happy, but she's also very intense.\n\nIt can be confusing.\n\nNo, no, no, that's not what's bothering me.\n\nIt's just that, well, I looked at the guest list earlier, and Jianyu isn't invited.\n\nRight.\n\nJianyu is a beautiful spirit, but he literally doesn't talk, and since this will be an evening of lively conversation, and you'll be busy working, I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable.\n\nI totally understand.\n\nWell reasoned, Michael.\n\nAs us Brits are fond of saying, \"try your best to hide your sadness.\"\n\nSo, the concept of the self is a key subject for a lot of great thinkers.\n\n\n\nIn the \"Tao Te Ching,\" Lao Tzu wrote, \"Knowing others is wisdom, but knowing the self is enlightenment.\"\n\nAhh, \"knowing\" yourself.\n\nIs he talking about what I think he's talking about?\n\nNo, Eleanor. Once again, none of these philosophers is ever talking about masturbation.\n\nLet's move on to this week's main event, David Hume's \"A Treatise of Human Nature.\"\n\nYou read this, right?\n\nI did.\n\nWell, I tried to.\n\nWell, I tried to want to.\n\nUm, actually, could we postpone this lesson?\n\nI've befriended Jianyu from next door, and I thought I could learn from him.\n\nThat's a great idea. Hume's \"bundle theory\" of the self is fairly close to Buddhism.\n\nYeah. No durr. That's why I'm doing it.\n\n[distant music thumping]\n\nDo you hear music?\n\nThat's not music.\n\nThat's EDM.\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nEleanor, you were right.\n\nNo more pretending. It's time for me to be myself.\n\nWhat's up, homie?\n\nEleanor?\n\nYou broke Jianyu.\n\nOkay, did we miss anything?\n\nUgh, take that jersey off, you goofball.\n\nOkay. This is not my fault. I swear.\n\nEleanor, one hour ago, that man was a silent Buddhist monk.\n\nRight. But here's the thing: Jianyu is actually... a guy who is nice.\n\nHi, Tahani.\n\nEleanor, Chidi, What a lovely surprise.\n\nDon't mind me. I'm just dropping off my afternoon gloves, and picking up my early evening gloves.\n\nHow are you, soul mate?\n\nI'm cool.\n\nI'm sorry. [laughs]\n\nAm I going mad, or did I just hear you say, \"I'm cool\"?\n\nMmm, mm-mm.\n\nI don't think so. I don't think that happened.\n\nYou're... you're wrong.\n\nI see what's going on here.\n\nYou've got a whisper in your snickerbox.\n\nYou're both helping Jianyu to regain his confidence to be able to speak again as a surprise for me!\n\nOh, busted.\n\nMy heart is soaring.\n\nSo, Jianyu is talking? Oh, how wonderful!\n\nI will do everything in my power to encourage him.\n\nWell, not everything. I won't give him a second mouth.\n\nUnless that would be helpful. No.\n\nBetter not risk it.\n\nI've actually had a better idea.\n\nOh.\n\nLet's add Jianyu to the guest list.\n\nChidi and Eleanor have been working with him, and they're going to be here.\n\nWhat a great idea. Patricia!\n\nWe can fit another chair, right?\n\nChange the floor plan an hour before opening?\n\nOf course! The more the merrier!\n\nHurrah!\n\nI knew tonight was going to be perfect, but now it's going to be even perfect-er.\n\nObviously, it's impossible for something to be more perfect than perfect...\n\nWell, it isn't, actually.\n\nAny place or thing in the universe can be up to 104% perfect.\n\nThat's how you got Beyonc\xe9.\n\nOh!\n\nOh,\xa0bud-hole.\xa0Okay.\n\nNow, tell me everything.\n\nOkay, Jianyu... is a fraud, just like me.\n\nHis real name is Jason.\n\nHe's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.\n\nIt's gonna be fine. We just need a plan.\n\nOh, I got a plan.\n\nWe hack into Michael's phone, download all his nudes, and then blackmail him.\n\nNo. What are you t... no.\n\nYo, you should listen to me.\n\nI came up with hundreds of plans in my life, and only one of them got me k*lled.\n\nDude, be quiet.\n\nYou are not Jason. You are a monk named Jianyu.\n\nGot it?\n\n[sighs]\n\n[crowd cheering]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n[music stops]\n\nHoo hoo hoo!\n\nOh, another great set, Jason.\n\nThey love you, dude.\n\nThey don't love me, man.\n\nThey love Acidcat.\n\nThese cheers are fake.\n\nThey hit my ears like boxing gloves of sadness.\n\nWhoa, that's some poetic thoughts, B.\n\nI got to be myself.\n\n[crowd cheering]\n\nAttention, Jacksonville.\n\nI'm not Acidcat.\n\nI'm Mr. Music, the DJ.\n\nAnd this is a Mr. Music, the DJ original.\n\nPow!\n\n[dance music plays]\n\nWhoo!\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n[crowd booing]\n\nAah!\n\n[glass clinking]\n\nWelcome to the opening of The Good Plates.\n\n[laughs]\n\nI just got that.\n\n[laughter]\n\nThat's hilarious!\n\nAnyway, at some point or another, every resident in this neighborhood will fulfill his or her soul's true purpose.\n\nChef Patricia has done that tonight by opening this restaurant.\n\n\n\nNow if you'd all like to take a look at tonight's menus...\n\nThat's right. With Michael's help, Chef Patricia has recreated each person's favorite meal on Earth.\n\nFun! [laughing]\n\n[chatter]\n\nIt's my Grandmother's maafe.\n\nFresh perch, slow-roasted in a peanut sauce.\n\nAlmost makes me forget how miserable I am right now.\n\nYou want to try a bite?\n\nFish and peanut butter? No, I'm good. Thanks.\n\nTofu? Oh, man.\n\nI'ma order some jalape\xf1o poppers.\n\nShh. Be quiet and eat your white sponge.\n\nJanet?\n\nHi, there.\n\nHi. I didn't get a meal.\n\nAccording to our files, your favorite meal was the hunger strike you went on to protest Bolivian sex trafficking.\n\nOh, right. Of course I did that.\n\nTahani, great party. Check it out.\n\nSuspenders! [laughing]\n\nSo dumb.\n\nSo much dumber than belts. [laughing]\n\nOh, congratulations, Michael.\n\nHow's Jianyu doing? Is he opening up?\n\nMm, not yet.\n\nBut I can tell he wants to.\n\nDon't worry. I've got a plan.\n\nMay I have your attention, please?\n\nLater this evening, we will be enjoying Chef Patricia's delicious dessert, a stunning three-tiered cake that took her a full week to complete.\n\nBut first, I'd like to try something fun.\n\nEach one of you has a very special memory attached to the meal you're eating.\n\nWhy don't we go around the room and share our stories?\n\nWho'd like to begin?\n\nI'll start, Michael.\n\n[clears throat] One day, I wasn't feeling so great, so I made myself a bowl of this chicken soup...\n\nWhen it gets to you, say something short and boring about tofu.\n\nNo. I'm sick of pretending to be Jianyu, the tofu man.\n\n\n\nI'm gonna tell the story about my real favorite meal.\n\nWhich is?\n\nThe Buffalo wings at Stupid Nick's Wing Dump in Gainesville.\n\nWings were free for ladies if they took their top off.\n\nOh, boy.\n\nChidi, a word?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnyway, that's how this simple soup saved over 10,000 lives.\n\nIf Jianyu starts talking about topless Buffalo wing restaurants, we're all screwed.\n\n\n\nJianyu Li,\xa0a Taiwanese monk who took a vow of silence at the age of eight and hasn't spoken since, is ready to share with us.\n\nLet me tell you about Stupid Nick.\n\nWe need a distraction right the fork now.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no. Eleanor, Chef Patricia poured her heart and soul into this.\n\nDestroying it would be a truly cruel act.\n\nYeah, no durr.\n\nNo, no, no... oh!\n\n[all screaming]\n\nSinkhole! Everyone out!\n\nThere's a sinkhole!\n\n[all screaming]\n\nAah!\n\nGlenn!\n\nYou broke the world.\n\nThat's not a compliment.\n\nGlenn, stay calm.\n\nWe're gonna get you out of there.\n\nAnd we'll put your soup in the fridge so it won't go to waste.\n\nI know that may not be your number one concern right now, but...\n\nIt was up there. It's real good soup.\n\nLet's go.\n\nHey, buddy. You okay?\n\nNo. I was just about to tell an awesome story about a wing eating contest that I lost and a barfing contest that I won, but then a hole opened up in the ground.\n\nI know. I made the hole to save you from yourself.\n\nYou cannot let people know who you really are.\n\nIt would be very, very bad.\n\nBeautiful, beautiful Jacksonville.\n\nWhat's wrong, dog?\n\nYou look like you're freaking out.\n\nThings are bad, Pillboi.\n\nAcidcat is suing me for \"bleach of contract.\"\n\nI should have never pretended to be someone else.\n\nIt could cost me all my dreams in life.\n\nYou got dreams in life? That's lit.\n\nOf course I have dreams, man.\n\nI don't want to be a DJ in Jacksonville forever.\n\nI want to DJ in Daytona, Tallahassee, Tampa, even.\n\nI want it all.\n\nThat's big goals, man.\n\nI know, but I believe in myself.\n\nSomeday, the world will see what I already know: that Jason Mendoza is a beautiful, unique soul who has so much to give this world.\n\nOkay, that's Acidcat's speedboat.\n\nHand me the thing that blows it up.\n\n[Pillboi yells indistinctly]\n\n[boom]\n\nMichael, I hereby tender my resignation.\n\nI can no longer in good conscience coordinate any further events in The Good Place.\n\nSo, I am turning in my evening gloves.\n\nTahani...\n\nDon't try to make me feel better.\n\nThe launch was a disaster.\n\nPoor Jianyu was so terrified that I fear he may never speak again.\n\nMy hair is barely cascading down my shoulders.\n\nTahani, please.\n\nI know your journey with Jianyu has been frustrating, but your situation is actually very typical.\n\nSoul mates sometimes take months to really click.\n\nYou have to be patient.\n\nAnd if anyone should take the blame for the restaurant disaster, it's me.\n\nI thought this neighborhood's troubles were behind us.\n\nNow I fear the worst.\n\nMichael, I hereby rescind the tendering of my resignation.\n\nWe must keep the neighborhood together.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nOh, well, the sinkhole should be repairing itself in about three days.\n\nWell, as soon as it does, we shall re-launch the restaurant.\n\nI'll hang posters to get the word out, and in the meantime, I'll host a brunch party every morning to lift people's spirits.\n\nAh!\n\nWhile you repair the universe, I shall prepare the eggs.\n\nOh, fanciful wordplay.\n\nIndeed. That is the Tahani that you know and love.\n\nSo what do we do here?\n\nThere's nothing to do.\n\nHe's just gonna blab and get him and me both sent to The Bad Place.\n\nIt's hopeless.\n\nI can't believe I'm doing this, but, Jason, please come to my classroom.\n\nI will teach you ethics, like I'm doing with Eleanor.\n\nAnd if you work hard and absorb the material, you just might be able to earn your place here.\n\n[light, suspenseful music]\n\nNo, I'm good.\n\n[game g*nf*re continue]\n\nDude, Chidi is giving you a lifeline right now, and you need to take it because you suck.\n\nYou suck!\n\nI know!\n\nThat's what I'm trying to tell you.\n\nWe both suck.\n\nYou know who doesn't suck? Chidi.\n\nHe is putting himself in danger to help us, because he, unlike us, is an amazing person.\n\nI didn't get into heaven to go to school.\n\nYou didn't get into heaven at all, shirt-for-brains.\n\nI just want to be myself.\n\nThat's a very, very bad idea.\n\nDo not be yourself.\n\nYou need to be a better version of yourself, okay?\n\nAnd I do too. And our only hope right now is this kind, selfless, amazing nerd.\n\nThink about that.\n\nDo you have to call me a nerd so much?\n\nI said a lot of other nice things, okay?\n\nToughen up, nerd.\n\nLet's get crackin', Teach.\n\nI read this entire David Hume book, and then I read it again because I didn't understand it the first time, and now I'm ready to go.\n\nWow, that's really impressive.\n\nWhere's Jianyu?\n\nHonestly, I don't even know if he's coming.\n\nI am here to learn about ethnics.\n\nWow, that's great, man.\n\nI mean, it's \"ethics,\" but that's great.\n\nPretty sure it's \"ethnics.\"\n\nHey, buddy, I'm proud of you.\n\nThis is your first step towards not sucking.\n\nCool. I just have two questions: when are football tryouts?\n\nAnd does this school have a prom?\n\nOh, no.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nFor the first time ever, I'm the smartest kid in class.\n\n[rumbling]\n\n[suspenseful music]\n\n[rumbling]\n\n[rocks clattering]\n\n[wood creaking]\n\n[gasps]\n\n[ominous music]\n    ]"},{number:5,title:"Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis",summary:"Eleanor Shellstrop arrives in the Good Place and meets her soulmate Chidi...",transcript:"[Good afternoon, Eleanor. What can I get you today?\n\nWhoa. Lot of new flavors.\n\nMichael felt bad about the sinkhole, so he wanted to give you all a little treat.\n\nI recommend \"Full Cell Phone Battery.\"\n\nWhoa.\n\nIt somehow tastes how I felt when my cell phone was fully charged.\n\nOh, I'm so relaxed.\n\nBut they all look good.\n\nThis might take me a while.\n\nYou know what, Gunnar, uh, why don't you go ahead?\n\nThanks so much, Eleanor.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nWhat can I get you, Gunnar?\n\nHi, Janet.\n\nCan I have some Folded Laundry?\n\nComing up.\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nChidi!\n\nYou'll never believe it.\n\nI was at the frozen yogurt place and I didn't know what I wanted, so I turned to the guy behind me, and I was like, \"Why don't you go ahead?\" [gasps]\n\nJust like that! \"Why don't you go ahead?\"\n\nO-okay?\n\nDude, you don't understand!\n\nI never did stuff like that when I was on Earth.\n\nBut now, thanks to your \"good person\" lessons, I didn't hold up the line.\n\nI didn't even try a dozen samples I didn't want just to spite some jerk who told me I was holding up the line.\n\nYou do that?\n\nNo, Chidi, I used to do that.\n\nNow I do selfless things without even thinking about it.\n\nThat's great.\n\nI-I'm proud of you.\n\nSo where's our yogurt?\n\nUgh. I forgot it.\n\nOh... Can you go?\n\nI don't want to go all the way back.\n\nI ran all the way here and it was so hot.\n\nI mean, I will happily get it, because I told you I would.\n\nGood person.\n\nSo, to sum up: Utilitarianism posits that the correct choice is the one that causes the most good or pleasure, and the least pain and suffering.\n\nI like this one. It's simple.\n\nUgh, screw all the other complicated theories, why didn't you start with this one?\n\nAh, but here's the problem.\n\nIf all that matters is the sum total of \"goodness,\" then you can justify any number of bad actions, like torturing one innocent person to save a hundred, or preemptive w*r...\n\nOh, dip, I get it.\n\nIt's like, I knew this girl Sheila?\n\nShe was a black market alligator dealer with a pierced jawbone.\n\nUm, okay, what?\n\nSheila was gonna get married to my boy, Donkey Doug and make him move to Sarasota.\n\nIt would've broken up my whole break dancing crew and Donkey Doug was our best pop-and-locker.\n\n\n\nSo I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards in Sheila's garage and called the cops.\n\n\n\nI framed one innocent gator dealer to save a 60-person dance crew.\n\n\n\nShockingly, that is a relevant example of the Utilitarian dilemma.\n\nWell done.\n\nThanks!\n\nUm...\n\nUh, yes, Jianyu?\n\nCan I be excused?\n\nTahani's doing a brunch party and I want to get there before all the mini-waffles run out.\n\nGo ahead, man.\n\nYes!\n\nSo, you want to roll right into another lesson?\n\nI am revved up to learn, man.\n\nMy brain is horny!\n\nUm, can we take a little break?\n\nI've been standing at this chalkboard all day.\n\nOh, yeah, I get it.\n\nOh, you could, um, grade my paper I wrote on the concept of Dharma.\n\nSix pages, and I didn't even do that thing where I try to make it longer by starting every sentence with \"Interestingly...\"\n\n\n\nSure, I'll do that and, uh... we can start another lesson.\n\nAh, Tahani.\n\nI've been working on my Western Hemisphere brunch banter.\n\nTell me what you think.\n\nThat \"New Yorker\" article was crazy.\n\nYou haven't seen \"Hamilton\"?\n\nHey, did you hear about Stephanie?\n\nVery well done, Michael.\n\nHi, there!\n\nWe have a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis.\n\nA Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSorry, what is a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?\n\nIt's nothing, it's a tiny little inconvenience.\n\nTahani, dear, could you show us to a private room where no one can see or hear us, even if I yell very loudly out of fear?\n\n[device chimes]\n\n[gasps]\n\nIt appears that the sinkhole is not repairing itself.\n\nThis is very bad, Janet.\n\nWe have to go into the sinkhole and fix it by hand.\n\nGet the tools.\n\nSorry, can I be of any service?\n\nAh, Tahani.\n\n_\n\nDidn't see you there. Uh, no, no.\n\nWe're just having a slight problem with the enormous sinkhole.\n\nYes, I meant to tell you...\n\nI walked past it last night and I...\n\nI actually saw it get a little bit bigger.\n\n[screams]\n\nIt got bigger?\n\nAh, well, that's... that's so normal.\n\nUm, this is the reaction I have when things are incredibly mundane and expected.\n\nI'm gonna leave now... at my regular pace, as I do in most scenarios.\n\nFinally!\n\nLet's get back to it.\n\nWhip out that chalkboard, big boy, show me what you're working with.\n\nActually, I was going to head into town and pick up some... blankets.\n\nGreat, I'll grab my sweater.\n\nI can practice letting people cut in front of me.\n\nYou know, uh, I just realized that I have blankets, so I'm going to take a nap using the several blankets that I already have.\n\nGood night.\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah.\n\nWhat's wrong? Out with it.\n\nI'm just tired, need a break. No big deal.\n\nThe way you're talking to me right now?\n\n\"Everything's cool, no big deal\"... I know that move.\n\nWhen I told a boyfriend something was \"no big deal,\" it meant anything from \"I just bought weed from your nephew,\" to \"I secretly befriended your ex-girlfriend last year, things got out of hand, and now I'm her bridesmaid.\"\n\nWow.\n\nOkay, well, in this case, it really is no big deal.\n\nDude, you're hiding something!\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nNothing!\n\nWhat... is... wrong?\n\n[device chimes]\n\nJianyu second.\n\nOh, well done, my love.\n\nSo where am I?\n\nEleanor... 6th?\n\nCome on.\n\nOh, no.\n\nI'm second to last.\n\nMummy, I made you this.\n\nIt's the pretty bird we saw in the garden.\n\nThank you, Tahani. It's very competent.\n\nI made a bird, as well.\n\nI worked in a reflective alloy, holding up a mirror to mankind and its mistreatment of these defenseless animals.\n\nExcellent, Kamilah.\n\nI sense the influence of Brancusi and Kapoor.\n\nIt seems you're moving out of your structural period, and more into conceptual abstraction.\n\nGood eye, Mother.\n\nI grew tired of objective representation.\n\nI trust my audience.\n\nMy birdie has a hat.\n\nYes, well done, Tahani.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nNothing's wrong.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nNothing's wrong.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nNothing's wrong.\n\nWould you stop doing that?\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nOkay, fine!\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nYou want to know what's wrong?\n\nYou are a full-time job.\n\nI wake up, there's Eleanor.\n\nI spend all day teaching Eleanor.\n\nAnd then it's, \"Good night, Eleanor.\"\n\nOh, this is a nice dream, my grandma's here.\n\nWait, she's got Eleanor's face!\n\nAnd tentacles for some reason.\n\nI thought you liked teaching me.\n\nSo now I'm just some huge burden for you?\n\nYes!\n\nOf course you are!\n\nI am in paradise!\n\nI should be doing paradise things, like rowing out on a lake with a good bottle of wine, reading French poetry.\n\nThat's your idea of paradise?\n\nYou know, and I can't stop helping you, because then I am shirking my ethical duty.\n\nIt's an impossible position!\n\nYou know what, if you're so stressed from writing on a chalkboard, why don't you just leave?\n\nWe can pretend to be soul mates in public, but other than that, we don't have to see each other!\n\nFine with me! I'll move out right now.\n\nFine!\n\n[alarm blares]\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nAs you all may remember, a sinkhole recently opened up in the town center.\n\nThe situation, sadly, has worsened.\n\nStarting right now, no one may go outside under any circumstances.\n\nLeaving your homes could result in catastrophic damage, to you and to the very fabric of the universe.\n\nOkay, bye.\n\nOr we could both just stay here.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your eternal stay in the Good Place.\n\nTake advantage of our day spa, or Janet... a magical assistant who can get you whatever you want.\n\nYou mind turning that off?\n\nIt's been playing on a loop for two days.\n\nThe whole Neighborhood is offline.\n\nWe only get the welcome channel.\n\nI would love to not\xa0\xa0watch\xa0\xa0TV, but you canceled school.\n\n[gasps]\n\nWhat have you done to me, you monster?\n\nLook at all these dishes piling up.\n\nI used to just throw them in the sink, and they'd be magically cleaned by morning.\n\nI did that. I cleaned the dishes.\n\nOh.\n\nThen what's up with these bad boys?\n\nYou are unbelievable.\n\nAre you still upset?\n\nYou're not over it yet?\n\nHow can I be over it?\n\nWe haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.\n\nWell, it sounds like you've had a really nice \"vacation\" from your \"full-time job.\"\n\nGet your story straight, bro!\n\n[knocking]\n\nHey, guys, it's Michael.\n\nHi, Michael, what a lovely surprise.\n\nOh, I'd love to make small talk... I've been practicing, too.\n\nI'm amazing at it... but I'm in a bit of a rush here.\n\nThis is Bart and Nina.\n\nThey live right next door to the, uh, sinkhole, so they obviously need a place to stay.\n\nI was wondering, as my assistant, maybe you could put them up for a while?\n\nOh, of course.\n\nDon't... don't think twice.\n\nOkay, shouldn't take long.\n\nBetween an hour and, um...\n\n11 months.\n\nSomewhere in there. Okay, bye.\n\nDon't go outside.\n\n[door closes]\n\nHa...\n\n[chuckles]\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to day three of our brunch siege.\n\nI stayed up all night to plan a full day of fun activities.\n\nJust check the schedule I made.\n\nTahani, you are truly the best.\n\nYes, you would think so, wouldn't you, Henriette?\n\n[device chimes]\n\nStill second to last.\n\n[sighs]\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\nTahani!\n\nThis auction threatens to be an embarrassing failure.\n\n5.2 million isn't bad.\n\nIt's very \"middle-thermometer.\"\n\nYour public failure is our public failure.\n\nYou know what has to be done.\n\nI'm very pleased to announce that there has been an addition to today's docket.\n\nI'm sure you all know my sister, Kamilah.\n\n[cheers and applause]\n\nYes. Kamilah.\n\nKamilah, of course, is the youngest person ever to graduate from Oxford University, she's a world-class painter, social activist, iconoclast, Olympic gold medalist for archery, a BAFTA Award-winner for her documentary on her Grammy Award-winning album, and the person voted \"Most Likely to be Banksy.\"\n\nSo without further ado, take it away from me!\n\nSorry, I mean take it away, Kamilah.\n\n[applause]\n\nI am auctioning off a lunch date with me.\n\n[crowd exclaims]\n\nThe bidding shall commence at \xa33 million.\n\n[excited murmuring]\n\n5 million!\n\n[crowd exclaims]\n\nThank you guys so much.\n\nSorry for the imposition.\n\nOh, bah.\n\nOh, well, if you want to know the truth, we asked Michael if we could stay with you.\n\nWe are obsessed with your relationship.\n\nAlways whispering, locking yourself in the house all day.\n\nI thought I was an expert in true love 'cause of my old job, but I have a lot to learn from you guys.\n\nYour job? What was your job?\n\nI was a marriage counselor.\n\nYou could say I wrote the book on healthy relationships.\n\nAnd I did!\n\n[both laughing]\n\nIt's called, \"How to Spot Problems in a Marriage From 100 Miles Away.\"\n\nboth: Oh, cool.\n\nReally cool.\n\nCool.\n\nReally, really cool.\n\nCool, cool.\n\nAnd what about you, Bart?\n\nOh, well, my job wasn't nearly as interesting.\n\nI started a company that investigated identity theft.\n\nAnalyzing body language, tracking and catching people pretending to be someone they're not.\n\nIt's... pssh, snooze, am I right?\n\n[both chuckling]\n\nThey're gonna catch us!\n\nThis is an extremely precarious situation!\n\nI am vexed, Eleanor!\n\nA marriage counselor and a human lie detector isn't my first choice for company, either.\n\nBut they have no reason to suspect us!\n\nPlus, I think they may have actually just come here to, you know, swing.\n\nI say we do it.\n\nIt'll get 'em to stop asking questions.\n\nNo, I am not going to have sex with someone to get them to stop talking to me!\n\nReally? You and I are very different.\n\nYeah, I noticed!\n\nYou know what, man?\n\nI have spent every second in this place worried I was gonna get caught, but if we go down right now, that's on you, okay?\n\nOh, you spend all your time teaching a charming, awesome lady?\n\nHow sad for you. Face it, dude.\n\nI'm the best thing that ever happened to you.\n\nBecause guess what, Chidi?\n\nYa basic!\n\nEleanor...\n\nYeah, I know, you want to do that thing where we're arguing and fighting, but then suddenly it's like, \"Whoa, this is hot,\" and we start making out.\n\nDream on!\n\nOr, whatever, fine, let's just do it.\n\nNo, Eleanor, look.\n\nSo how much of that did you hear?\n\nWe couldn't hear you, but I'm an expert in non-verbal communication, and it is clear... you are in conflict.\n\nWe're not judging you.\n\nThis has been a tough couple of weeks.\n\nI'm sure the stress of the sinkhole has caused lots of soul mate squabbles.\n\nYes, that's what it is.\n\nA squabble.\n\nWe're squabbling.\n\nSquabble, squabble!\n\nI can help.\n\nI'm gonna take your relationship and put it under a microscope and dig and poke and prod until you are back to soul mate harmony.\n\nEleanor, why don't you...\n\nShe never does the dishes. I have to do them all the time.\n\nWe just have different interests.\n\nI like relaxing, he likes getting on my case about the dishes.\n\nI'm getting a lot of repressed anger.\n\nI suspected this when I arrived, but now I'm sure.\n\nYou are hiding something.\n\nWhat on earth would I be...\n\nNo, no, no, not you.\n\nHim.\n\nPlease go back inside.\n\nIt isn't safe to be out of your home.\n\nPlease go back inside.\n\nJanet, could you see what's wrong?\n\nEverything.\n\nUgh.\n\nMy goodness!\n\nIt's even worse than I thought.\n\nTahani, what're you doing here?\n\nWell, everyone else might be okay staying inside, but I wanted to help.\n\nSo I've brought some cheer and sustenance to raise your spirits.\n\nLook, I made donut holes.\n\nDo you get it? \"Donut holes\"?\n\nSinkhole.\n\nFunny, no?\n\nNo, too soon.\n\nBy exactly nine days.\n\nTahani, this sinkhole is incredibly dangerous.\n\nIf a human gets too close to it, there could be disastrous side effects.\n\n[shimmering tones]\n\nWhat's... what's happening to me?\n\nOh, that's one of the side effects.\n\nJanet, knock her out while we still have time.\n\nKnock me out? What does that...\n\nBoop.\n\nGuys, really, it's no big deal.\n\n\"It's not a big deal\" is nearly always code for \"something is wrong.\"\n\nBoom! That's what I said.\n\nI should've been a marriage counselor.\n\nOkay, Chidi, out with it.\n\nWhat is so unsatisfying about your soul mate relationship?\n\nBe honest, Chidi.\n\nBe, like, the exact right amount of honest so that we can both be happy.\n\nI never had a soul mate on earth.\n\nI-I never even really had a girlfriend that I \"loved.\"\n\nAnd when I got here, and Michael said I would finally meet my actual soul mate, I was so excited.\n\nAnd it isn't... exactly... what I thought.\n\nYou've never had an intense relationship before.\n\nThis is all uncharted territory.\n\nNo wonder you're so tense.\n\nYou know, Nina and I are skilled in the art of massage.\n\nUh, not erotic massage.\n\nAlthough, it can be, and it often leads there, anyway...\n\nOkay, well, you know what?\n\nYou guys have given us so much to think about.\n\nAnd I think we should go to bed.\n\nJust the two of us, alone. Just us.\n\n[whispers] I know it's not the right time, but I told you.\n\nTahani, wake up, dear.\n\nMichael.\n\nDid it work?\n\nDid I fix the sinkhole? Am I a heroine?\n\nNo, you did something catastrophically stupid and we had to knock you unconscious.\n\nWhy in the world did you go outside?\n\nBecause I saw the rankings in the manual.\n\nThat manual is only meant to be seen by Architects and Janets.\n\nIt's got some very sensitive material.\n\nPlus some song lyrics I've been working on, and I'd rather not let people see those until they're finished.\n\nAnyway, why did seeing the rankings unravel you so?\n\nI was so sorry to hear of your parents' passing.\n\nPlease bear with me as I share their last will and testament.\n\n\"To Kamilah, we have left \xa368 million, the home in Kensington, the yacht, and other assorted weekend boats.\"\n\nWell, what did they leave their second favorite child?\n\nThere's still quite a lot of money and property that goes to you.\n\nThere is one issue, however.\n\nThey have, um, spelled your name incorrectly in the will.\n\nYou've got to be kidding me.\n\nIt says, \"We bequeath the rest of our estate to Tahini.\"\n\nLike the sauce.\n\nYou know what?\n\nI don't want the money.\n\nMy sister can have it all.\n\nMy whole life, I have lived in your shadow, but now I'm going to step out of it.\n\nI am going to reach heights of success and sophistication that you can only dream of.\n\nYour cardigan's on inside out.\n\nI know!\n\nIt's a new trend that I am starting.\n\nJust one example of how I'm going to step out of your shadow.\n\n[sighs]\n\nOh, I'm sorry that I looked at the rankings, Michael.\n\nBut I just don't understand how I'm so low.\n\nMy entire life, I have tried to be extraordinary, but it just never seemed to be enough.\n\nAh.\n\nAnd you thought you could increase your ranking by helping us fix the sinkhole.\n\nTahani, the point evaluations stop the moment you die.\n\n\n\nBut also, out of literally billions, you were one of the most remarkable people on Earth.\n\nYou have nothing left to prove, to anyone.\n\n[chiming]\n\nHi, there.\n\nThe sinkhole has begun to repair itself.\n\n[gasps]\n\nIt has?\n\nCould it be...\n\nBut how...\n\nDid I...?\n\n\"Tahani saves the un...\"\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nStill not you. You have nothing to do with it.\n\nWe've got to leave immediately.\n\nIt's now safe to go outside.\n\nIt's now safe to go outside.\n\nIt's now safe to go outside.\n\nMorning, teach!\n\nMorning.\n\nWhat's this about?\n\nWell, here's what I realized.\n\nIt's not just that helping me is a full-time job that you feel you have to do.\n\nThe real problem is, that the more you help me, the greater the chance is that I can stay here, and me staying here means you'll never get a real soul mate.\n\nI'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.\n\n[laughs]\n\nEvery ounce of my happiness leads to a ton of pain for you.\n\nSo every time the simple fact of my existence starts to bum you out, I want you to hold this up.\n\n[laughs] _\n\nAt which point, I will leave you alone for as long as you need.\n\nI know we'll never be soul mates, but we're friends.\n\n\n\nNow get in this boat and read some boring French poetry.\n\nI... I've never actually done this before.\n\nThis is a theoretical fantasy.\n\nHow do you row a boat?\n\nI'll tell ya, it's good as new.\n\nGo ahead, if you want, just... here.\n\nWhoo! See?\n\nYou can jump up and down on it.\n\nHey, boss. So you fixed the sinkhole.\n\nYup, good as new. Crisis averted.\n\nEverybody have a wonderful day, because I fixed the sinkhole.\n\nI didn't fix the sinkhole.\n\nSorry?\n\nI tried and I tried, but nothing worked.\n\nAnd then all of a sudden... this morning, out of the blue, it just... whoop!\n\nIt just closed over.\n\nHuh.\n\nHow 'bout that?\n\nWell, as your assistant, I officially declare this good news.\n\nNo, this is terrible news!\n\nI have no idea what caused it, Eleanor.\n\nAnd no idea what fixed it.\n\nI want you to come to my office first thing in the morning.\n\nYou and I are gonna find this problem.\n    ]"},{number:6,title:"What We Owe to Each Other",summary:"Eleanor Shellstrop arrives in the Good Place and meets her soulmate Chidi...",transcript:"[[upbeat music]\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\n[gasps]\n\nDude, I'm freaked out about my meeting with Michael, and if I spend one more second staring at Creepo the Clown, I'm gonna lose it.\n\nYou named the clowns?\n\nPsycho, Creepo, Crazy Head, Stupid Juggling Weirdo, Freaky Feet, and Nightmare George Washington.\n\nOne of them has to go.\n\nOh, sexy mailman. Much better.\n\nIn five minutes, Michael wants my help investigating what's making the neighborhood go nuts, which is obviously me.\n\nI mean, I did promise I would help.\n\nWhat do I do here?\n\nActually, the answer is...\n\nRight here in this easily understandable comic strip.\n\nNope, in this book about the theory of contractualism.\n\n\"What We Owe to Each Other.\"\n\n[gasps] I saw this movie.\n\nLaura Linney cries in a lake house because Jude Law left her for his ex-wife's ghost.\n\nNo.\n\nQuick summary of contractualism.\n\nUh, imagine a group of reasonable people are coming up with the rules for a new society.\n\nLike if your Uber driver talks to you, the ride should be free?\n\nSure, but anyone can veto any rule that they think is unfair.\n\n\n\nSo if you said, \"We should be able to break our promises without any repercussions,\" someone would veto that rule.\n\n\n\nWell, my first rule would be that no one can veto my rules.\n\nWell, that's called tyranny.\n\nAnd it's generally frowned upon.\n\nIf you make a promise to someone, you should do it.\n\nJust like I promised to help you and still am, despite your constant mockery.\n\n[mockingly] \"Despite your constant mockery.\"\n\nWhatever, you love it.\n\nSo either I help him find the problem, which is me, and I'm doomed, or I don't help him, and then I'm behaving unethically and the whole world goes crazy and I'm caught anyway.\n\nI need to figure out a way both help him and not help him at the same time.\n\nThat's literally not possible.\n\nOh, really?\n\nI once posed as a hot prom date for my cousin, both helping him and later, according to his therapist, not helping him.\n\n[mumbling indistinctly]\n\n[knocking]\n\nOh, hey, Eleanor, thanks for coming in.\n\nSorry about the mess.\n\n[clears throat]\n\nOh, I forgot, you don't see in nine dimensions.\n\nThere's just a lot of... there's a lot of tension in the air right now.\n\nAre you okay, buddy?\n\nYou seem kind of stressed.\n\nNo, no, no, I'm fine.\n\nTop of my game, actually.\n\nUh, here, let me just, uh...\n\nHave a seat.\n\nThere you go.\n\nSo to prepare to meet all of you, I studied the human concept of friends.\n\nI even watched all ten seasons of the show \"Friends.\"\n\nBoy, those friends really were \"friends,\" weren't they?\n\n\n\nAlthough... and I realize this is the kind of observation that would only occur to the mind of an eternal being...\n\nHow did they afford that apartment?\n\nA waitress and a chef with those Manhattan real estate prices.\n\nYeah, we were all confused about that too.\n\nAnyway, it's been a tough couple of days.\n\nRight now, I could really use a friend by my side.\n\nWell, you know me.\n\nThe person who has audibly promised to help you.\n\nSo you need to me house-sit the whole week?\n\nSounds like somebody's gonna have a sweet vay-cay.\n\nAs I told you before, my mom is very sick.\n\nI'm gonna help her move into assisted living.\n\nWell, I'm here for you.\n\nAnd your Wi-Fi is way better than my neighbor's, so I'm in.\n\nIt's gonna mean taking care of Lester too.\n\nWalk and feed him twice a day.\n\nGive him his kidney medicine.\n\nYup, got it... feed his kidneys.\n\nEleanor?\n\nYeah?\n\nThis is gonna be a very stressful week for me.\n\nI need to know that I can count on you.\n\nI won't let you down.\n\nI promise.\n\n[sighs]\n\nJianyu, my love.\n\nHow are you?\n\nI am decidedly so.\n\nThat's very profound.\n\nUm, soul mate... an idea.\n\nOur neighborhood now features a spa, and it offers couples packages.\n\nAnd I thought maybe we could get facials and do yoga and talk in long, discursive sentences.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nSigns point to yes.\n\nOh!\n\nMarvelous. We'll go today.\n\nDude, you got to come with us to the spa.\n\nNo way.\n\nNo, that's really weird.\n\nYou can't make small talk with her for one day without being caught?\n\nNo, I can't, and she freaks me out.\n\nShe's so pretty, like Nala from \"The Lion King.\"\n\nAnd she talks so smart, like, um...\n\nNala from \"The Lion King.\"\n\nYou got to help me.\n\nWell, if I feel sympathy for anyone, it's Tahani.\n\nShe's going through the same thing I am, but she doesn't know it.\n\nWhich means maybe I'm obligated to tell her.\n\nAlthough maybe it's better not to know.\n\nIs ignorance bliss, or will the painful truth actually be healing...\n\nYou ready, Jianyu?\n\nOh, I cannot wait to just relax and talk and chat and just, you know... get to know each other.\n\nHey!\n\nMaybe I'll come too.\n\nOh.\n\nWell, Chidi... it's just that this is, um... this is really more of a couples thing.\n\nI know.\n\nBut Eleanor's off with Michael, and Jianyu feels comfortable when I'm around.\n\nRight?\n\nMade in Taiwan.\n\nYes, you were.\n\nYou were made in Taiwan.\n\nSo... couples date!\n\nLet's go!\n\nI never really looked around your office the first day.\n\nWhat is all this junk?\n\nWell, technically, architects aren't allowed to own any human objects, but... oh, I just love them so much.\n\nAnd over here, look at this.\n\nAren't paper clips the most amazing things in the world?\n\nYeah. Sure.\n\nAnyway, my current theory is that some object in the neighborhood is a design flaw which is causing everything to go haywire.\n\nSo we need to find that object.\n\nWe're gonna start with the rocks.\n\nNow, I've investigated all of the rocks in the neighborhood.\n\nThese 78 are the most suspicious.\n\nMaybe to an architect, they might look suspicious, but to me, they just look like rocks, so I'm not sure how I can help.\n\nDo any of them look defective?\n\nSinister?\n\nYou know, like they're taunting you?\n\nAlways one step ahead?\n\nYou devious little monsters, you.\n\nOkay, let's take a deep breath here, buddy.\n\nYou need to chill a little.\n\n'Cause you have a very psycho, \"burnout guy muttering to himself at a library computer\" type vibe.\n\nIt's my responsibility to solve the problem.\n\nWhat else can I do except keep working?\n\nYou could stop working.\n\nLook, I promised to help you, and honestly, the way I can help you is to force you to take a break.\n\nAnd not working will help me work?\n\nYes!\n\nRecharge the old batteries.\n\nI promise this is gonna help both of us.\n\nLet's go.\n\nOkay.\n\nLet's keep our eyes peeled for twigs that may have a nefarious agenda.\n\nOkay, crazy, come on.\n\nYeah.\n\nHello, Janet.\n\nJianyu and I are here for the couples package, please.\n\nAnd also I will be joining them.\n\nGreat, and who is the other half of your couple?\n\nOh, no, no, it's just me.\n\nCouples are pairs of people.\n\nYup, and, uh, there is a pair of people, Tahani and Jianyu.\n\nAnd then also I am here.\n\nGreat, and who will be joining you?\n\nNo one.\n\nUm, it's really quite simple, Janet.\n\nThey are a couple, and I am a third part of that couple.\n\nUh, a helper part who is here for fun and excitement.\n\nIt's a three-person couple.\n\n[robotically] Does not compute.\n\nDoes not compute.\n\nI'm just kidding. [laughs]\n\nI mean, it doesn't compute, but I'm not gonna explode or anything.\n\nRight.\n\nWell, I'll see you inside, darling.\n\nOkay, you have to step up.\n\nFind a way to connect with her without, you know, being you.\n\nWhat does that even mean?\n\nDo I talk or not talk?\n\nDo I be nice to Tahani, or do I throw all her jewelry in the toilet?\n\nThat's the opposite of being nice?\n\nSo no toilet?\n\nWhat is it with you and frozen yogurt?\n\nHave you not heard of ice cream?\n\nOh, sure, but I've come to really like frozen yogurt.\n\nThere's something so human about taking something great and ruining it a little so you can have more of it.\n\n[chuckles] That is very human.\n\nWhy do you need a human to be your assistant?\n\nI mean, aren't there more of... whatever you are?\n\nWell, since we're becoming friends, like Ross and Phoebe...\n\nWeird combo to pick, but okay.\n\nI'm gonna tell you a secret.\n\nUsually, architects don't live in their neighborhoods.\n\nUsually, the people show up, we play the movie, Janet is there to answer questions, and you're on your own.\n\nBut I had this theory.\n\nI thought transition would be easier if the architect were on-site for at least the first 1,000 years or so.\n\nThat's why you've been so freaked out.\n\n'Cause your butt is on the line.\n\nMy boss thought I was nuts.\n\nAnd if this neighborhood doesn't work, I am in big trouble.\n\nBut more importantly, I promised all of you that you would be safe and happy.\n\nAnd you just don't break a promise.\n\nUnlike Ross when he promised Emily not to talk to Rachel.\n\nWow, you are really into that show.\n\nYou know something?\n\nI feel better already.\n\nShould we get back to work?\n\nGah, gah, gah, gah, gah.\n\nThe whole point is to stop thinking about work and start having fun.\n\nNow, what should we do first?\n\nboth: \u266a I'm going out \u266a\n\u266a In a blaze of glory \u266a\n\u266a Lord, I never drew first \u266a\n\u266a But I drew first blood \u266a\n\u266a And I'm no one's son \u266a\n\u266a So call me young g*n \u266a\n\nWhoo!\n\nThis is so interesting!\n\nI mean, there's no point to it.\n\nThe images on the screen relate to nothing.\n\nSome time passed, and then it was over.\n\nThat's karaoke!\n\nOh, let's do it again.\n\nOkay, my hands are heated to the ideal 105 degrees.\n\nWho would like to go first?\n\nOh, well what if I go first, and then perhaps Jianyu could stand near me and share some intimate aspects of his life?\n\nOr what if... while Janet messages Tahani, I massage Jianyu?\n\nJianyu, darling, let's discuss the arts.\n\nI adore the impressionists.\n\nWho's your favorite artist?\n\nI mean, Pitbull changed the game...\n\nSorry, just working the oft-neglected mandible area.\n\n[muffled speech]\n\n[playful music]\n\n[laughs]\n\nOh, man!\n\nI didn't even want that thing.\n\nWhy am I trying to win it?\n\nBecause the machine says it's a prize.\n\nOh!\n\nBoom!\n\nHow many tickets do I get? Six?\n\nIs that all?\n\nWell,\xa0\xa0watch\xa0this.\n\n[pounding]\n\nIs that allowed?\n\nNot really.\n\nBut it is a time-honored tradition.\n\nSay no more. I got it. I got it.\n\nWhoo!\n\nWhoo!\n\n[clapping]\n\nYou know something?\n\nAs much as I've always wanted to be around humans, I think I've missed a big part of what makes them wonderful.\n\nSometimes all you guys think about is how you can have the most fun.\n\nExactly!\n\nThat was practically my mantra.\n\nWhat's up, dong bait?\n\n[laughs] Drop everything you're doing.\n\nRihanna is performing in Vegas.\n\nI got tickets. We are road-tripping.\n\nOh, I can't!\n\nI promised I'd house-sit one more day, and I have to feed this stupid dog.\n\nI'm sorry, does this dog smoke blunts topless on a yacht like a boss?\n\n'Cause that's how Ri-Ri do.\n\nThat's a very good point.\n\nThis is floor seats in Vegas for Rihanna.\n\nThe booze is free there.\n\nDo I really need to keep going?\n\nOkay, this is dinner tonight, breakfast tomorrow...\n\nI have an idea.\n\nThis is in case of emergency.\n\nDo not eat this unless it's an emergency.\n\nWow.\n\nI'm ready to be a mom.\n\n[relaxing music playing]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nI'm having trouble getting this mask to stick.\n\nYes, it's 'cause my pores are just so small.\n\nThere's no way anything could ever adhere to my skin.\n\nIt's a curse, really.\n\nJianyu?\n\nWhat are your pores like?\n\n[sighs]\n\nJanet, can you show me to the sauna, please?\n\nDude, she's trying so hard, and you're giving her nothing!\n\nJust pick a fact that you know about her and just muddle through.\n\nShe said she likes impressionist paintings.\n\nImpressionist paintings?\n\nOkay, say no more.\n\nNo, no, no, I definitely feel like I need to say more.\n\nJia...\n\n[laughs]\n\nSo would you say I helped you today?\n\nOh, so much.\n\nI had fun, I didn't think about my problems, and I won this ugly yellow toddler, which is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAll right, I'll see you tomorrow, friend.\n\n[romantic music playing]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nYou sure this is where you want to be right now?\n\nAt the Tea for Two couples cafe?\n\nThere's no use avoiding it, Chidi.\n\nI'm alone.\n\nJianyu and I have nothing in common.\n\nI just want a soul mate.\n\nSomeone I can share my passions with, someone who I can talk to about the ethereal colors of a Degas.\n\nI love Degas.\n\nI took painting lessons as a kid, and Degas was always my inspiration.\n\nAnd do you like France as much as I do?\n\nWell, they enslaved my country for 300 years.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut they have great museums.\n\nYes.\n\nWelcome to my cafe, you two.\n\nWe have a special on soul mate muffins.\n\nTwo for the price of zero.\n\nEverything is free.\n\nOh, uh, we're not soul mates.\n\nNo.\n\nWe're just, uh... soul friends.\n\nOh.\n\nHey, buddy.\n\nI have all new fun stuff for us to do today.\n\nEleanor, I have huge news.\n\nNot working actually worked.\n\nIt did what now?\n\nAfter our day off, with a completely clear head, I realized part of what makes humans so fun is that they're unpredictable.\n\nThe chaos we've been experiencing is exactly what would happen if a resident behaved unpredictably.\n\nThe problem in our neighborhood... it's not a rock or an object.\n\nIt's one of the people.\n\nOh!\n\nWe need to celebrate!\n\nI know, okay...\n\nPaper clip shower!\n\nSo do you think we're looking for a man, or do you think we're looking for two men?\n\nNot sure.\n\nWe don't know anything about this person.\n\nI mean, does he or she even know that they caused all these problems?\n\nNo, that can't be.\n\nI mean, what kind of monster would wreak havoc and then say nothing?\n\nSo this is the main place where the garbage fell from the sky.\n\nJanet.\n\nHi there.\n\nI need a list of everyone that was here on garbage duty during orientation.\n\nOh.\n\nEleanor, our criminal is on this very short list.\n\nPeople were flying that day too.\n\nI'll add everybody who flew overhead.\n\nUgh.\n\nEleanor, our criminal is on this much longer list.\n\n[sighs]\n\nOh, hey, homey.\n\nThanks for your advice.\n\nI'm about to give Tahani the best gift ever.\n\nCheck it.\n\nWhat?\n\nShe likes impressionist paintings, right?\n\nI got her a painting of the best impressionist of all time, Frank Caliendo.\n\nHe can do it all... fat Al Pacino, fat Jerry Seinfeld, regular John Madden.\n\n\"Say hello to my little friend.\"\n\n\"Forget about it.\"\n\nThis is where the sinkhole opened up.\n\nAnd the guest list that night was limited.\n\nThere were a total of 30 people here that night.\n\n[laughs]\n\nOnly 30, huh?\n\nHow do you pump your fists again?\n\nIs this it?\n\nBut 66 others passed through to take a look before it opened, and everyone else in the neighborhood was in a close radius.\n\nOh, boy, that... doesn't narrow it down at all.\n\nFeels like the end of the road.\n\n\"End of the Road,\" Boyz II Men, karaoke.\n\nLet's go... don't think about it too much.\n\nJanet.\n\nMy hoodie, please.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nI give up.\n\nI can't help the people I promised that I would help.\n\nI feel like \"Friends\" in season eight, out of ideas and forcing Joey and Rachel together, even though it made no sense.\n\n\n\nI hope the sinkhole opens up again and swallows me whole.\n\nPaula!\n\nHey, girl.\n\nHow's the dog?\n\nStill fat, Eleanor.\n\nStill fat.\n\nThe vet says his stomach expanded to the size of a basketball and that it will never shrink.\n\nOh, well, that's not my fault.\n\nHow was I supposed to know he would literally eat all of the food?\n\nIt shouldn't have been an issue.\n\nYou were supposed to be there, but you broke your promise as soon as it wasn't convenient for you, and now I have a very bulbous dog.\n\nWell, you know what?\n\nYou're rude.\n\n'Cause you didn't even ask me how the Rihanna concert was.\n\nShe was very late.\n\nAnd a little drunk.\n\nI promised to help you, and I will, however I can.\n\nIf you want to look at a million rocks like a psychopath, I'll be there.\n\nIf you want to just lay here and cry in your hoodie, I'm cool with that.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I don't

Michael's wrong.\n\nHe's not the problem.\n\nWell, Michael did bring me here, which was the mistake that led to all the other problems.\n\nSo, in that sense, he is the real problem.\n\nHa! How do you like them ethics?\n\nI just ethics'd you in the face, Chidi!\n\nIt doesn't change the fact that we weren't truthful.\n\nThere's an old Chinese proverb...\n\n\"Lies are like tigers.\n\nThey are bad.\"\n\nThat's it?\n\nIt's more poetic in Mandarin.\n\nLook, Michael is retiring.\n\nHe's gonna be on an angel boat somewhere, smoking moonbeam cigars.\n\nNow, Tahani is throwing him a good-bye party.\n\nLet's go help out.\n\nSure, that will more than make up for the pain and misery and lying.\n\nYes, now you're getting it.\n\nHey, Chidi, just read your article on logical positivism... so dry.\n\nOh, thanks, Henry.\n\nWhoa!

Why would I tell Henry that I liked his boots?\n\nI don't like his boots. I hate his boots.\n\nYes, I know.\n\nYou've talked about it for the last two days.\n\nI lied to him. You wrote your thesis on Kant.\n\nHe believed that lying is always morally wrong... no exceptions.\n\nYes, well, Kant was a lonely, obsessive hermit with zero friends.\n\n\n\nSometimes we do thing just to be polite, but if you really feel that strongly about it, tell him the truth.\n\nAlso, I don't care, 'cause it's the middle of the night.\n\n[sighs]\n\nThis is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.\n\nThey do?\n\nHey, Chidi.\n\nYou sit in on my class today?\n\nUh, I did, yeah.\n\nGreat lecture, by the way... so bleak.\n\nThanks, bud.\n\nIt's actually perfect that you are here.\n\nI got something for you.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nYou loved mine so much, I decided to get you your own pair.\n\nWe can be boot brothers.\n\nWow. I can't accept these. They're too expensive.\n\nSure you can.

Soon I won't be... forever.\n\nBecause of The Eternal Shriek!\n\nYes, thank you, Glenn.\n\nLook, what I'm trying to say is this...\n\nMichael, you always kept us warm and safe like a bright, glowing sun.\n\nLike the one I kicked the dog into or the one I'm going to be burned on the surface of for eternity?\n\nOkay, no more speeches.\n\nSpeeches are over.\n\nMichael's going to talk now.\n\nUgh, I'm sorry I was so grumpy.\n\nIt's just I'm sad that I have to leave before doing all the human things that I wanted to do.\n\nI wanted to get my hair wet.\n\nYou know, I-I wanted to pull a hamstring.\n\nTo learn the difference between \"toward\" and \"towards.\"\n\nI wanted to do that thing where you walk down the hallway, and someone else is walking the other way, and then you both lean to one side and then the other, and then you both chuckle over your shared foible.\n\nI wanted to get a rewards card, any rewards card.\n\nI-I wanted to talk briefly to someone and then say, \"Take it sleazy.\"\n\n[chuckles]\n\nI wanted to eat a saltine.\n\nOh! I actually have some saltines.\n\nHere, try this.\n\n[crunching]\n\nPretty dry... and too salty.\n\nWell, going out on a real low note here.\n\nOkay, bye, everyone.\n\nWell, take it sleazy.\n\nYou got to say it?\n\nYes, but then you say it back.\n\nNo, it's not organic.\n\n[somber music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nUh, Janet, how many \"Janets\" have there been?\n\nThere have been 25 generations of Janet.\n\nEach new update of Janet gains more wisdom and social abilities.\n\nFun fact... the first Janet had a click wheel.\n\nSo it's like aging for a human?\n\nYou're... you're growing up?\n\nThat's how I like to think of it, Chidi.\n\nI can't eat, so every time there's a new version of Janet, I like to take a piece of birthday cake and smash it around where my mouth is.\n\n[sighs]\n\nLook, Janet has... has learned and grown.\n\nShe's essentially living a life. We can't k*ll her.\n\nNot with that attitude, we can't.\n\nListen, man, I'm dead, you're dead, we all died, and now we're k*lling her.\n\nPay it forward.\n\nUh, no, that's not what that means at all.\n\nEleanor?\n\nHere we are.\n\nJust press that button, and it's good-bye, Janet.\n\n[groans]\n\nChidi, I can see that you're worried, and I just want to assure you, I am not human, and I cannot feel pain.\n\nAh, thank you. That helps.\n\nHowever, I should warn you...\n\nI am programmed with a fail-safe measure.\n\nAs you approach the k*ll switch, I will begin to beg for my life.\n\nIt's just there in case of an accidental shut down, but it will seem very real.\n\nCool. So who's doing this, me or you?\n\n[stammers] I think I have to.\n\nUm, being a bystander seems worse, somehow.\n\n[sighs]\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\nChidi, no, no, no!

What am I supposed to do if he asks me?\n\n\n\nI don't know. Kant would say that lying in any scenario is wrong, so if Michael asks you if you k*lled Janet, you should say yes.\n\nOn the other hand, snitches do get stitches.\n\nThat is true.

You've been a big help.\n\n[low tone]\n\nListen up, genius.\n\nHe's gonna call you in there in a second.\n\nDon't worry, I got you.

[laughs]\n\n[classical music]\n\nAll right, Michael, we're going to ply them with delicious food and drink, and then we're going to subtly segue into negotiation.\n\nThey're sure to be in a good mood.\n\nEverything is absolutely beautiful.\n\nThis sucks, dude.\n\nYeah, this food, uh, blows.\n\nYo, Good Janet.\n\n[beep]\n\nHi, there.\n\nOh, huh, gimme some jalape\xf1o poppers.\n\nSure, quick question: what is a \"jalape\xf1o\"?\n\nAlso: what is a \"poppers\"?\n\nAlso: what is \"jalape\xf1o poppers\"?\n\nOops, sorry, guys. Uh, see, in the confusion, Janet got rebooted, so she hasn't quite uploaded all of the info she usually knows.\n\n[laughter]\n\nThat's hilarious.\n\nShe's almost as stupid as people.\n\nOh, hey now, come on. Let's not insult people, please.\n\n[as Michael] Uh, I'm Michael, I love, uh, idiot humans!\n\n[laughter]\n\nI gotta admit... that does sound like me.\n\n\"I got to admit... that does sound like me.\"\n\nOh, nailed it again.\n\n[laughter]\n\nGo get me a drink.\n\nYes, of course.\n\nAw, man, this is gonna make a primo dump later on.\n\nWell, that looks delicious. What is that?\n\nOh, it's Tom Yum Goong soup. It reminds me of when I was in Thailand rescuing victims of human trafficking.\n\nOoh, that sounds so good. I mean, um, the soup, not the... human trafficking.\n\nOh, and I think your grilled eggplant looks so good.\n\nShould we...\n\n[together] Splitsies?\n\nYeah! [laughs]\n\nI can't believe you thought you could pretend to be Real Eleanor.\n\nShe's like a perfect ball of light, and you're like a... wet pile of mulch.\n\nSomeone made a person out of wet mulch and leaves and, like, dead slugs, and that's you.\n\nWhatever, it's easy when you're just born perfect.\n\nMy parents were both dirtbags who split up when I was eight.\n\nI don't mean to eavesdrop, but did you say your parents got a divorce?\n\nYeah, and that kind of thing really changes a person.\n\nI mean, that trauma... It can explain away a lot of behavior.\n\nOh, of course.\n\nYour parents are still together, I guess.\n\nOh, actually, um, I... I'm not sure.\n\nI never met my birth parents.\n\nThey put me in an empty fish t*nk and abandoned me at a train station in Bangladesh.\n\n[groans]\n\nLuckily, I was found and adopted by a very nice couple, the Shellstrops...\n\nOh, thank God.\n\nBut then they died when I was four... bird flu.\n\nThat's awful.\n\nAnyway, orphanage burned down, yadda yadda yadda, made my way to America, yadda yadda yadda, learned English from watching \"Seinfeld,\" put myself through law school, and here I am.\n\nHuh. And, I'm sorry, what...\n\nWhat is it you said happened to you?\n\nThe same thing that happens to half of all kids in America?\n\n[laughs]\n\nAnd for you to have gone through all that, and to end up where you did, it is just...\n\nIt's just amazing.\n\nOh, man, these horndogs are vibing like mofos.\n\nAm I right, Fake Eleanor?\n\nPlease, stop calling me that.\n\nOh, you got it, third wheel.\n\n[laughs]\n\nYeah, that wine's no good. I'm sending it back.\n\nHey, Janet.\n\nYou look sad.\n\nPeople keep asking me questions that I don't know the answers to.\n\nThat was my whole life on Earth.\n\nYou know, it doesn't matter if you know things.\n\nAll that matters is what's in your heart.\n\nThanks, Jianyu. I mean, it does matter if I know things, because I'm an informational delivery system, and I don't have a heart, but thanks.\n\nJianyu, I know usually you ask me questions, but can I ask you a question?\n\nSure.\n\nWhat are jalape\xf1o poppers?\n\nOh, I know this one!\n\nOkay, they're deep fried jalape\xf1os filled with cheese.\n\nHm.\n\nOne time, at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Jacksonville, but the nice one, not the one above the gas station, I ate 50 of them in two minutes.\n\nEveryone at the hospital was so impressed.\n\nGot it. Thanks, Jianyu.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n[light music]\n\n\u266a\n\nWhy did you do that?\n\nBecause you're the only person here that's nice to me.\n\nOkay.\n\n[light music]\n\n\u266a\n\nAnyone up for a little, uh, icebreaker?\n\nYou know, I once did trust falls with Barry Diller, and it was the beginning of a lifelong friendship.\n\nAnd then once we trust each other, then we can discuss making a deal for Fake Eleanor.\n\nThis sucks. How do you guys eat without listening to hard-core porn?\n\n\n\nOh, come on, this is the Good Place, you can do anything you want.\n\nWhat about throwing a rager and totally trashing this place?\n\nWhoo-hoo, yeah, I'd be into that.\n\nMm, we could totally go to town.\n\nYou know, I actually don't think that's such a good idea.\n\nLet's party!\n\n\u266a Who let the dogs out? \u266a\n\n\u266a Who who who who? \u266a\n\nOh, my God!\n\n\u266a Who let the dogs out? \u266a\n\u266a Who who who... \u266a\n\nSo, um, Chidi tells me that he's teaching you about ethics.\n\nYeah, actually, we've had some interesting and in-depth classes. He taught me about Plato and Socrates, Immanuel Kant...\n\nYeah, cool, shut up.\n\nLet's cut to the chase here... You two go to Poundtown?\n\nPoundtown, bro. You two bang it out?\n\nShe hot for teach? Did you pork the dork?\n\nC'mon, girl, dish me dem dirty deets.\n\nI assure you, our relationship was \"teacher-student,\" nothing more.\n\nChidi, you don't have to explain anything to me.\n\nWhatever happened before I arrived is none of my business.\n\nHey, I'd love to see the rest of the neighborhood.\n\nUh, yes, it's... it's incredible.\n\nUm, there's an amazing library, there's a beautiful, piranha-free lake.\n\n[laughs]\n\nWell, please, show me everything.\n\nYou ready, Eleanor?\n\nI've seen it all already. You guys go ahead.\n\nYou'd rather be alone with him?\n\nFire in the hole...\xa0\xa0watch\xa0your heads, ladies.\n\nMy dudes tend to boomerang around the room.\n\nYeah, I mean, I don't need to walk around and nerd out about old books. I'm good.\n\nOkay.\n\nHey, a bunch of us are gonna go see \"Spider-Man 2\" tonight. Do you want to come?\n\nThey made a second \"Spider-Man\"?\n\nWhat is there left to say?\n\nSure, whatever, I'm in.\n\nCool, okay, well, I'll get tickets for the eight of us, and you can just pay me back in cash.\n\nSo you can get all the points on your credit card, and the rest of us get screwed?\n\nNo way.\n\nNo, it's just so we can all get tickets before they sell out.\n\nDo you want to buy them?\n\nSo you guys can never pay me back, and I'll be out like 80 bucks?\n\nNice try. I'll buy my own ticket.\n\nThe rest of the group can do whatever they want.\n\nWhere did she end up?\n\nBought it with points, baby. My points.\n\nI think I need to find a new place to live.\n\n- [electronic music]\n\nOh... no, no, no, no.\n\nDon't... Don't...\n\nAll right. Ha.\n\n[sighs] Want a bump?\n\nNo, thank you, I... I don't use cocaine.\n\nOh, it's not cocaine, idiot. We're snorting time.\n\nSorry... you're snorting the concept of time?\n\nYeah, it'll fork you up.\n\nYo, monk dude, you know how to tap a keg?\n\nKaraoke time!\n\nWhoo!\n\nDana, baby, what do you wanna do?\n\nOkay, Mussolini's speech? Ooh, the Mel Gibson rant?\n\nThat's a classic.\n\nClassic... Ooh, let's do the Nixon Tapes... that's my jam!\n\nYeah!\n\n[in Nixon's voice] \"What you always have to remember about the Irish is they get mean. Virtually every Irish I've known gets mean when he drinks.\"\n\n[cheering]\n\nWhoo!\n\nMichael, tell them to stop.\n\nOh, I think I made it pretty clear that I don't approve.\n\nHey, idiot.

Why haven't you forkers invented a medium place?\n\nLook, I know you've been trying to become a \"better person,\"\n\nI mean, you didn't want to get caught. I get it.\n\nBut I read your file...\n\nYou don't belong here.\n\nI mean, she spent her weekends breaking up dog fighting rings.\n\nYou once saw a meter maid writing you a ticket, and you barked like a dog till she ran away.\n\n\n\nI mean, honestly, you'll be happier in the Bad Place.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, you'll be miserable.\n\nWe will t*rture you, but you'll also be happier because you won't have to keep trying to fit in somewhere you just don't belong.\n\n[sighs]\n\nA'ight.\n\nLet's go.\n\nOkay, hold on, I have to ask: is this thing gonna happen?\n\nYou and me?\n\nEw, no, gross.\n\nOkay, you know I had to ask, babe.\n\n\u266a\n\nOh, Tahani, I'm so sorry.\n\nI will obviously clean all of this up.\n\nI don't care about the house, Michael.\n\nI'm just upset that you let them walk all over you.\n\nI know... they're the only thing in the Universe that scares me.\n\nI know what I have to do.\n\nI just have to be... more accommodating.\n\nOffer them everything they want, give in to all of their demands, and then they'll have to respect me.\n\nNo, you need to stand up for yourself.\n\nI'm going to tell you the same thing that I told Mark Zuckerberg right before he ousted Eduardo Saverin.\n\nYou are smart, you are capable, and the time has come to hit \"unfriend.\" I also told Mark to lose the \"the\". Just \"Facebook.\"\n\nThat was me.\n\n[coughs]\n\n[spits]\n\n[groans] Oh... Oh, my head.\n\nHere, drink this.\n\nHow am I hung over?\n\nI thought there were no hangovers here.\n\nWell, the Bad Place Crew requested the hangover filter be turned off. They like them.\n\nSo, Michael said we're meeting at Tahani's place in an hour for a negotiation session. We'll walk over together?\n\nYou don't have to come, man. I'm good.\n\nJust hang out with Real Eleanor and name constellations after each other, or whatever it is nerds do.\n\nI'm fine on my own.\n\nYeah, Eleanor, just because we have a new guest in the house doesn't mean I'm not still gonna be there for you.\n\nI'm in this. We're a team.\n\nSo you've been temping for us for a year now, and we want to bring you aboard permanently.\n\nWe think you'd be a great addition to the team.\n\nYeah, no. Uh, I'm good.\n\nYou're turning it down?\n\nI just don't think I'm really one of you guys.\n\nYou're all obsessed with this place, man.\n\nYou love working here and talking about working here, and you all hang out like some kind of cult.\n\nWe hang out after work because we're friends.\n\nI know. It's weird.\n\nIf this is how you really feel, I... I think I have to fire you.\n\nSeverance pay. Love it.\n\nGood looking out, boss.\n\nPeace!\n\nYou need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake allergy medicine.\n\nI get it, man. Which one's my desk?\n\nThat one, over there.\n\nAll you gotta do is hit your minimal sales target every week.\n\nCool. And you guys don't have any lame, mandatory office hangouts, right?\n\nHell no.\n\nSome people go out for a drink after work, and I like to run the occasional group drill to see how fast we can shred evidence, but that's it.\n\nMost days, you'll be able to avoid even talking to another person here.\n\nPerfect. Happy to be a part of the not-team.\n\nIt'll be a pleasure not hanging out with you.\n\nAll right, let's begin negotiations.\n\nNow, we would like to discuss various trades that we could...\n\nOh, yeah, we're not negotiating.\n\nSee, Fake Eleanor and I, we bro-ed down pretty hard last night. We hooked up.\n\nNo, we didn't.\n\nYeah, but who are they gonna believe... me or a woman?\n\n[laughter]\n\nPoint is she knows that she doesn't belong here, and she's giving up.\n\nIs this true?\n\nFake Eleanor, are you giving up?\n\nYeah, of course she is. She knows this place isn't for her. Let's go, dingdong.\n\nCome on.\n\nNo, I'm not leaving.\n\nOh, come on, sweetheart, we've been through this.\n\nYou know you don't belong here.\n\nYou're right. I don't...\n\nBut I want to.\n\nI used to never want to be a part of any group, but I'm a different person now because of the person who helped me, and I want to be like him.\n\nI want to be like all the people who are here.\n\nYou can, Eleanor.\n\nThanks, Real Eleanor.\n\nHey, if you two aren't gonna make out, just shut up.\n\nLook, if you don't come with us, we're gonna have to turn this matter over to Shawn.\n\nOh, oh, no, um, Shawn, really?\n\nWha... uh, who's... Who's Shawn?\n\nHe's the wise, eternal Judge who sits on high, has the final say on all disputes between our two realms.\n\nAnd his name is... \"Shawn\"?\n\nOkay, look, I don't want Shawn involved either, so how about you blow us away with an offer so we can end this.\n\nOkay...\n\nHere's my offer.\n\nYou... get... nothing.\n\nWe're not letting Fake Eleanor go, and we're not giving you anything.\n\nGet him, Michael!\n\nYou can summon every evil creature you have, every w*apon in your arsenal, every four-headed flying bear... they have them down there... but we are not giving up. I believe that Eleanor belongs in the Good Place. If I'm wrong, you can take her to the Bad Place and punish her all you want, just really go to town on her.\n\nGah, gah, gah, easy, buddy, easy.\n\nBut she's staying here.\n\nNow, all of you...\n\nGet the fork out of my neighborhood.\n\n[suspenseful music]\n\n[chuckles] You're on borrowed time, Fake Eleanor.\n\nEnjoy it while it lasts. Let's roll, dummies.\n\nLet's get one drink for the road.\n\nBye.\n\nDid you guys hear any of that?\n\n[collective sigh of relief]\n\nOh, my...\n\nBravo, Michael, really. [Tahani claps]\n\n\u266a\n\nHello, Jianyu.\n\nYou got sloppy. I found your junk food all over the house, and then, last night,\xa0you knew how to tap a keg. So I thought I would\xa0come in here and investigate your little \"meditation\" den.\n\nWhat I found was this.\n\nNow, I don't know who you are, but I do know that you're not a Buddhist monk.\n\nSo let's chat, shall we?\n    ]"},{number:10,title:"Chidi's Choice",summary:"Eleanor Shellstrop arrives in the Good Place and meets her soulmate Chidi...",transcript:"[Number five is number one. Number seven is number two. Number three and number four are tied for number three.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nI'm ranking my favorite \"Fast and the Furious\" movies.\n\nYou said you wanted to know who I am, and this is the best way to get to know me.\n\nNo, it isn't.\n\nYou could tell me your real name, for starters.\n\nMy name is Jason Mendoza.\n\nI'm from Florida.\n\nAnd I'm a professional amateur DJ.\n\nAnd is, uh, that a family member?\n\nI wish. That's Ariana Grande, the sexiest woman alive.\n\nYou wish that you were related to a woman you want to have sex with.\n\n\n\nYou know what? It'd be one thing if you just weren't a Buddhist monk, but you're barely even a regular, functioning person.\n\nHow did you get here?\n\nI don't know, but, please, dawg, you can't tell Michael about me.\n\nYou have some nerve asking me for favors when you have spent weeks deceiving me, making a fool out of me, and bringing snack food into my house.\n\nDisgusting.\n\nOh, Ariana, we're really in it now.\n\nShawn, the judge, could show up at any moment, so we need to have a rock-solid argument for why Fake Eleanor should not be sent to the Bad Place.\n\nShould be fun.\n\nThat's the spirit!\n\nDon't even think about the fact that our slightest misstep could cause Fake Eleanor to suffer for eternity.\n\nThat's all I'm thinking about now.\n\nYep, shouldn't have said that. Regretted it immediately.\n\nBambadjan was a human rights advocate, so he and Real Eleanor will build a sort of legal argument.\n\n\n\nUm, ahem, could you please just say \"Eleanor,\" and maybe point to whichever one of us you're addressing?\n\n\n\nWell, actually, the fake/real distinction helps me.\n\nOh, does it, Bambadjan?\n\nNow, I know a fair amount about your time on Earth.\n\nWhy don't you tell me about your time here?\n\nAnything that might help your case.\n\nWell, in the first 24 hours, I caused the world to erupt into chaos, and then I caused a garbage storm. It was kind of a rough start, but things calmed down after Chidi started helping me learn about ethics.\n\nOkay, tell me about that.\n\nWell, I studied with Chidi every day, and then Chidi got sick of me, so I did some nice stuff to make him feel better.\n\nAnd later, I confessed because Chidi was being tortured by guilt, and I just felt awful seeing his little, nerdy face all contorted.\n\n\n\n[as Chidi] Oh, Eleanor, I have a stomachache because of what you did.\n\n[laughs]\n\nHe is such a dork.\n\nYou know, a lot of death row inmates feel regret about things they never said... admissions of guilt or anger... or love.\n\nAre you making a move on me?\n\nIt's fine... I just didn't see it coming.\n\nUh, well, hooking up with someone with the exact same name, it is kind of a fun, narcissistic fantasy...\n\nNo, no, Eleanor, I... I'm talking...\n\nI could be into it.\n\nMm, no, I'm talking about you and Chidi. Now, ordinarily, you having feelings for my soul mate would be a conflict of interest...\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\nYou think I'm into Chidi?\n\nYes, Eleanor, I do.\n\nBecause you are.\n\nYou mentioned his name nine times in the last ten minutes.\n\nNobody asked you, Bambadjan.\n\nI'm not sure what will work with Shawn, but we should have all our bases covered.\n\nShall we start with the Greeks or would you prefer the modern British masters?\n\nChidi?\n\nI'm sorry, choices are hard for me when I'm under pressure.\n\nI know that, buddy, but we're short of time here, and it's kind of important for Eleanor.\n\nRight, which is why I can't take this lightly.\n\nWhat if I screw up?\n\nListen, I don't need the Chidi who once had a panic attack during Rock-Paper-Scissors because there were, and I quote, \"just too many variables.\"\n\nI need the Chidi who stormed in here and told me to stop Eleanor's train without thinking of consequences.\n\nOh, boy, now I'm nervous about that decision.\n\nRetroactively? I mean, h... how do you even...?\n\nI don't know.\n\nOkay, we have so many big choices to make.\n\nLet's... let's start small.\n\nDo you want to use a dry erase board or the regular pen and paper?\n\nJust pick.\n\nChidi, just pick!\n\nCome on, Chidi, pick someone.\n\nDon't pressure me, Uzo. I have to consider all the factors.\n\nAthletic strategies, the fragile egos of my classmates, and gender politics.\n\nShould I pick a girl as a gesture towards women's equality, or... or is that pandering?\n\nOr do I think it's pandering because of my limited male point of view?\n\nI'm vexed, Uzo, vexed.\n\nYou're always vexed. Just pick.\n\nOkay, fine, uh, I choose Tokunbo.\n\nYou can't draft the teacher. Pick a kid.\n\nall: Come on, Chidi. Just pick someone.\n\n[bell rings]\n\nCongratulations, Chidi.\n\nYou filibustered recess.\n\n[sighs]\n\nNo, no, no, you're wrong.\n\nThere are way more things I hate about Chidi than like about him.\n\nLike what?\n\nHis stupid Clark Kent glasses, his extensive turtleneck collection, oh, and he loves ethics so much.\n\nHe once talked about John Rawls for two hours... I timed it.\n\nAnd he only stopped because he saw me timing him.\n\nGranted, he laughed, and kind of made fun of himself, it was a nice moment, but still.\n\nHe always twitches his eyebrows when he says \"absolutism,\" and he tilts his head whenever I say anything ignorant, but he never makes fun of me, which is nice.\n\n\n\nHe's also incredibly patient, and kind, and surprisingly jacked, and, oh, fork, I'm in love with Chidi.\n\n\u266a\n\nLet's take a little break.\n\nI know this is awkward, but as your advocate, and, I hope, friend, I think you should tell Chidi how you feel.\n\n\u266a\n\nWould a hug make you feel better?\n\nNo, I don't think that it would...\n\nOh, too late, you're getting one.\n\nThanks, Bambadjan, that does make me feel better.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\n\u266a\n\nYet another lie.\n\nYou didn't paint this.\n\nYou got Janet to do it.\n\nNo, no, no, Chidi did it.\n\nI got you an awesome painting, but then he switched it to this one because he said you'd like it more, and he made me memorize stuff to say to you so you wouldn't be so sad.\n\nThis is all his fault.\n\nYou should yell at him.\n\n[scoffs] Chidi helped you make me happy.\n\nIt's almost as if he was trying to...\n\nOh, oh, my.\n\nOf course.\n\nThis is the cool painting I made.\n\nThis guy's famous.\n\nI mean, who even are those ladies?\n\n\u266a\n\nYeah, it would be easier to sort out the issue of dry erase versus paper if I could write down the pros and cons for each, but, of course, I would have to use one of them to write down the pros and cons for them, which is problematic.\n\nWow.\n\n[claps] Ethics team, how's it going?\n\nTerribly.\n\nCool.\n\nWell, you guys are kind of my last hope, so that's not great.\n\n[groans]\n\nHey, do you mind if I borrow Professor Stomachache here for a second?\n\nPlease, take him for an hour, take all the time you want.\n\n\u266a\n\nOkay, sit down, maybe.\n\n[clears throat]\n\nI dated many annoying guys, okay?\n\nThey would call me all times of the day \"just to talk\" or ask me if I'd taken cash out of their wallets, stupid stuff.\n\nAnd when I stopped having fun with them, I'd leave. Usually wouldn't even call or anything. I'd just bounce.\n\nGotta go spend that money you stole.\n\nPoint is, you are way more of a buzzkill than any of those dudes.\n\nOkay, thanks for this conversation.\n\nBut, somehow, I never want to leave you.\n\nI want to stay in the Good Place because of you.\n\nBecause I love you.\n\nI think.\n\nNo, I'm pretty sure. Yeah, I love you.\n\nUgh, that's embarrassing. [laughs]\n\nI feel so itchy. Sorry.\n\nDon't say anything.\n\nI just needed to get that off my chest.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna go.\n\nCatch you later, silly Billy.\n\nUgh, love has made me a nerd.\n\nBye.\n\n\u266a\n\nJianyu's a fake.\n\nHe's not supposed to be here. Just like your \"soul mate.\"\n\nMore importantly, you did the ballerina painting 'cause you were trying to protect my feelings, because you love me.\n\nOh, Chidi, don't you see? This is the real mistake that was made in our neighborhood.\n\nYou and I are soul mates. It makes so much sense.\n\nOh, but...\n\nNo, Chidi, true love is rare, like a desert flower betwixt two oases, but true love's also very simple.\n\nAnd right now, I'm just a girl... towering over a boy... asking him to admit he loves me.\n\nI feel like her confession of love was a lot better than mine. Can I get a do-over?\n\n[light music]\n\nI need to step outside... for some air, and I will not be back for many days.\n\nDude, you can't just run away.\n\nYou have to...\n\n[sighs]\n\nIt looks calm now, but the storm is imminent.\n\nWe're...\n\nWhat's up, Carson Daly?\n\nMy name is Jason.\n\nI wanna give a shout-out to all my homies up in Jacksonville.\n\nI am not Carson Daly.

What are you watching?\n\nMy greatest accomplishment ever.\n\nI'm trying to cheer myself up because I'm sad.\n\nI think I might be in big trouble.\n\nCan you bring me something that will make me not-sad?\n\nLet me think.\n\n[beep]\n\n[beep]\n\nSorry that took so long.\n\nHere you go.\n\nOh, dang.\n\nAre these from my favorite restaurant, Stupid Nick's Wing Dump?\n\nStupid Nick's closed down because a pelican fell in the flash fryer, but he opened a new place called Ugly Nick's Meat Trench.\n\nThese are an exact replica of that recipe.\n\nWhy are you so nice to me?\n\nWell, you were very nice to me while I was rebooting.\n\nAlso, I'm programmed to be nice to everyone.\n\nJanet?\n\nI just realized something.\n\nI love you.\n\nOkay.\n\nI have one more question for you.\n\nSo you also love Chidi, and you... you just told him, just now, right before I did?\n\nTechnically, you told him that he loves you, but yes.\n\n[sighs] This isn't ideal.\n\nWe must remain civil.\n\nHe's simply going to have to pick one of us, and the loser will just have to accept her fate with grace and equanimity.\n\nMaybe if you lose.\n\nIf he doesn't pick me, I'ma start throwing stuff.\n\nClassy as always.\n\nI suppose you knew that Jianyu was a fake, didn't you?\n\nYes, I did.\n\nFigured you two charlatans would sniff each other out like two mangy rats sharing a pizza crust in a sewer...\n\nOkay... no.\n\nWe're not gonna do this.\n\nWe are not gonna be those women who fight over a guy and find any excuse to rip each other apart.\n\nI am not going to apologize for being angry.\n\nYou knew that my soul mate was lying to me.\n\nYes, I did, and I'm very sorry.\n\nListen, you and I have a weird, complicated, forked-up friendship, but it's our friendship, and I care about it.\n\nLet's do something fun.\n\nWhat would make you feel happy, right now?\n\n[with British accent] You have a fine home, Deirdre...\n\nI absolutely adore your shares.\n\n[with Cockney accent] I don't know bugger all about\xa0a shares... I been using this as a bloody toilet, I have.\n\n[laughs]\n\nWhat's this show called, again?\n\nIt's \"Deirdre and Margaret.\"\n\nIt ran for 16 years on the BBC.\n\nThey did nearly 30 episodes.\n\nIt's about two women from very different worlds who become friends, sort of like us.\n\nOh, Deirdre, no! That's priceless art!\n\nI thought it was fruit, innit?\n\n[laughs] Deirdre.\n\nI take it the moron is me?\n\nWell, it's not a direct parallel.\n\nOkay, we did your thing.\n\nNow it's my turn.\n\nAre you ready to take our bonding to the next level?\n\n[light music]\n\nOh, good, you're back.\n\nYeah, I, uh, I know we're short on time, but I need your help with a personal dilemma.\n\n[sighs] This is about Fake Eleanor and Real Eleanor.\n\nYes, which person is my soul mate?\n\nReal Eleanor, that's what the system determined.\n\nOkay.\n\nOf course, the system did screw up by letting Fake Eleanor in.\n\nYou know, it's interesting.\n\nFake Eleanor being selected accidentally and then you bonding with her could have shifted the formula.\n\nRight, it's one of those two people.\n\nWell, I d... I don't know. I mean, the system might be so screwed up at this point that maybe you don't belong to either Eleanor.\n\n[tense music]\n\nOh...\n\nYou is spreading...\n\nWhat?\n\nYour indecisiveness is infecting me like a virus.\n\nOh, Chidi, this could send us down a very dangerous path.\n\nIf you can't make a choice, this whole neighborhood could fall apart.\n\nOkay, getting close here.\n\nJust mulling the ethical ramifications of various soups.\n\nAh, same old Chidi.\n\nI can come back for a fifth time.\n\nYeah, you know, maybe that's smart.\n\n[laughs]\n\nHow are you? Uzo, it's been too long.\n\nIt has, it has. Look, as you know, Ellen and I are engaged. You're my oldest friend, and I love you like a brother, and that's why I'd like you to not be my best man.\n\nSorry?\n\nLook, if you were my best man, you'd have to plan the bachelor party, decide what to say in your toast, handle problems that pop up the day of.\n\nIt would drive you up the wall.\n\nWell, Uzo, this isn't choosing soccer teams on a playground.\n\nWhen something's important to me, I can make a decision.\n\n\xa0Watch. Um, excuse me, excuse me.\n\nI have decided I would like to unequivocally order the pumpkin soup.\n\nPerfect.\n\nYou kind of want to change your order.\n\nYeah, I don't know what I was thinking.\n\nExcuse me, Risotto. Risotto?\n\nYeah.\n\nAs much as I'm enjoying this, shouldn't we be working on your case to try and stay here?\n\nHonestly, how am I gonna help them?\n\nThey are much smarter than me. Now, hair extensions?\n\nThis is where I shine.\n\nYou were already at almost-maximum hotness, but now you look like a sexy, tan Rapunzel.\n\nUgh, the dream.\n\nAnd how exactly did you learn how to do this?\n\nWhen I was 14, I had to make myself look older to get a job.\n\nThese were the ones I used, and they are real cheap.\n\nYou're gonna want to stay away from open flames and altercations at outlet malls.\n\n[laughs]\n\nHey...\n\nI'm really sorry that I didn't tell you about Jianyu and that you got saddled with him.\n\nYes, that is regrettable, but...\n\nI forgive you.\n\n[laughs] Maybe you two are soul mates.\n\n[both chuckle]\n\n[suspenseful music]\n\nHoly shirt.\n\nMaybe we are.\n\nI know it seems crazy, but... but think about it:\n\nJianyu is a hot dummy, definitely my type.\n\nWe both love to dance, we were both banned from public transit systems in our cities.\n\nI think this is the answer.\n\nPeople come in pairs here, and if the system paired us up, then maybe somehow I do belong here with him.\n\n[beep]\n\nHi, there.\n\nJason and I are getting married in ten minutes, and you're invited.\n\n[quirky music]\n\nHere, we've got your soul mate options:\n\nEleanor, Real Eleanor, and a theoretical third person.\n\nLet's call her... strawberry mango twist.\n\nOkay, close your eyes.\n\nThink about each of the women.\n\nOpen your eyes.\n\nThe answer is Real Eleanor.\n\nHow do you know?\n\nI don't, but the minute I said that, you knew instinctively whether it felt right.\n\nWell, hang on, let me think about that.\n\nNo, no.\n\nBecause it...\n\nNo more thinking, Chidi. Just do something.\n\nIndecision caused you so much agony in your life, right up to the very end.\n\nI had a little trouble writing my speech.\n\nUm... I wrote 11 different versions.\n\nWedding's in 20 minutes, buddy.\n\nOh, boy, I mean, these run about 55 minutes a piece.\n\nI'm really hot.\n\nIs this air conditioner even working?\n\nYes, it is. You're just having a literal meltdown. Also, you're not dressed yet, and we haven't picked up the rings.\n\nOkay, well, uh, there's an issue there involving what I consider to be unfair labor practices on the part of the jeweler.\n\nAnd we never had a bachelor party because you could never settle on a location or time.\n\n\u266a\n\nI'm sorry, you were right.\n\nThis is too much for me.\n\nYou should just leave me here and go get married.\n\nYeah, here's the thing, bud: my wedding isn't for another month.\n\nThis was a test to see if you could handle being my best man, and, just as I predicted, you failed, miserably.\n\n\n\nOh, no. No, I mean, I'm... I'm relieved, but this is embarrassing.\n\nIt's okay, bud.\n\nObviously, I prepared for this.\n\nLet's just go have a nice night.\n\nI'll buy you a beer.\n\n30 minutes, Chidi?\n\nWe have been trying to pick a bar for 30 minutes.\n\nIt is literally impossible to be your friend.\n\nYou're incapable of making a single decision.\n\nLook, I know I can be indecisive, but what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes to find the perfect...\n\n[clang]\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nChidi?\n\nYou're right. I just need to make a decision.\n\nI'm gonna look each of these women in the eye, trust my gut, and figure out how I feel.\n\nYou're kidding. That worked?\n\nGreat! Go do it!\n\nHa!\n\nMan on speaker: Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to married.\n\n[electronic music playing]\n\n\u266a\n\nYo, check it.\n\n\u266a\n\n[laughs]\n\nThis is great.\n\nAt different moments during our time here, we both thought that Tragic Mike over here was our one true love, and now he is marrying whatever Janet is.\n\nI suppose you're right. It is a bit strange.\n\nI'd like to read a poem.\n\n\"Janet, my digital queen. Janet, we can dare to dream. Send nude pics of your heart to me.\"\n\n[gags]\n\n\"Jacksonville Jaguars rule!\"\n\nJason, when I was rebooted, and I lost all my knowledge, I was confused and disoriented, but you were always kind to me.\n\nAnd according to the central theme of 231,600 songs, movies, poems, and novels that I researched for these vows in the last three seconds, that's what love's all about.\n\nDoes anybody here object to this marriage?\n\nOf course we do... how could Yes, it is a terrible idea. we not object?\n\nOverruled.\n\nJason?\n\nMm-hmm?\n\nDo you want me to be your wife?\n\nYeah.\n\nI want you to be my husband.\n\nTight.\n\nSo, by the power vested in me, by me, I now pronounce us husband and wife.\n\nWe did it!\n\n[laughs]\n\nCan I kiss you, or will I be electrocuted?\n\nOnly one way to find out.\n\nWhoo, get some! Got get it, girl!\n\nI'm just going with it now.\n\n[laughter]\n\n[\"At Last\" by Etta James playing]\n\nIt's funny... I was devastated when I found out that he wasn't my soul mate, but now I think I've dodged a b*llet.\n\nHe's a simple man.\n\nI once watched him eat electrical tape right off the roll.\n\nHe thought it was a Fruit by the Foot that had gone bad.\n\nThank you for being such a great friend to me today.\n\n'Course, hot stuff. I got your back.\n\n\u266a\n\nEleanor, hey, I just wanted to see if you'd talked to Chidi.\n\nUh, yeah, I did.\n\nI mean, you don't have to tell me what you said.\n\nI just wanted to see if you're okay.\n\nOh, man, you are a good person.\n\nI swear, if I had known you and Tahani and Chidi on Earth, I might have for real gotten into the Good Place.\n\nOh, hey, it's my three favorite yogurts.\n\nHey, um, about what happened earlier...\n\nI've been kind of all over the place today.\n\nAn hour ago, I thought Jianyu was my soul mate, and the fact that that kind of made sense means you and I could never be meant for each other.\n\nPlus, Jianyu's married to Janet now.\n\nOkay.\n\n\u266a\n\nWhat?\n\nI do love you, but I think more in a best friend afterlife savior kind of way.\n\nI'm not so much \"hot for teacher\" as I am \"eternally grateful for semi-cute, surprisingly ripped teacher.\"\n\nChidi, I also have to apologize.\n\nIt's just that when I found out that Jianyu wasn't my soul mate, I-I desperately needed something to keep me afloat, and, well, you were the nearest lifeboat, as it were.\n\nAnd yes, we do have the sort of connection that only two highly educated, sophisticates could have, but it's not true love.\n\nTrue love is what Janet and Jianyu have.\n\nYeah. What?\n\nOh, we would love to stay and chat, but we need to find Michael.\n\nEleanor, I think I figured out a way for you to stay.\n\n[gasps]\n\nReally? I...

It gave me an idea.\n\nWe will apply the formula to Eleanor's actions here in the Good Place, and if you earn enough new points, then we could argue that you should stay here.\n\nWould that work?\n\nDon't know, never had to prove someone belonged here before.\n\nBut the judge will be here soon, and this is the best way to build our case.\n\n\n\nNow, the average point total for a resident here is roughly 1.2 million.\n\nRight now, based on everything that you did on Earth, you have -4,008.\n\nThat's not great, but I'm gonna do nice things for every goober in this place until my point total is so high I can rub it in all their smug faces.\n\n[beep]\n\nYou just lost five points.\n\nHello! Hi, how are you?\n\nThere has to be something bigger I can do than holding the door and waving.\n\nThere's no way every Walmart greeter is in the Good Place.\n\nWal... mart?\n\nIt's a place regular people go.\n\nYou haven't heard of it.\n\nLook, I know this is tedious, but holding a door for someone is three points, and if you do it for everyone in the neighborhood, then that's almost a thousand points for just a start.\n\nBesides, all the big ticket items are impossible, I'm afraid. It's not as if you could, you know, \"sacrifice your life to save others\" or \"change the consciousness of a nation.\"\n\nBoth of which I did, by the way.\n\nSuch fun.\n\nHave a wonderful day.\n\nThis is pointless.\n\nThe ticker isn't even going up, and everyone's giving me the stink eye.\n\nEleanor, everyone hates you.\n\nWell, fork you too.\n\nNo, this is good.\n\nNow that we know, we can actually do something about it.\n\nAnd I am an expert at mediating conflict, like when my friends Scary, Sporty, Posh, and Baby had an issue with my other friend Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\n\n\nYeah, I don't know what I love more about our morning hardboiled egg routine, the eggs or the routine.\n\n[laughs] Um, actually, this morning, there's a little surprise in yours.\n\n[gasps]\n\n\"I love you.\" How cute.\n\nI love you too, egg.\n\nOh, no, no, Chidi, that... that's me saying that to you.\n\nI love you.\n\nOhh.\n\n\u266a\n\nWell, that is... something.\n\nI know you've gone through a lot, and now I'm throwing this at you, but I just...\n\nI had to tell you how I feel.\n\nI love you. No need to respond.\n\nGreat.\n\nWell, at some point, you'll respond, right?\n\nI just meant no rush.\n\nYou wanna talk about eggs again?\n\n[laughs]\n\n\u266a\n\nHmm, this isn't right.\n\nI'm sorry, I've never kissed anyone before.\n\nIs one tongue okay?\n\nI can add more tongues.\n\nNo, that's not it.\n\nWe're married now, but we still haven't told your dad.\n\nOnce again, Michael is not my dad, and we shouldn't tell him.\n\nIf Michael finds out that we're married, then he'll know you're not Tahani's soul mate, and then he'll know that you're really Jason and not Jianyu.\n\nHe'd send you to the Bad Place.\n\nMm, I don't want to lose you, girl.\n\nI'm not a girl.\n\nBut also, I'm tired of living a lie.

I'll be right back.\n\nMe too. I'll race you.\n\n[laughter] both: Best friends!\n\nThank you all for participating in our focus group for Fake Eleanor.\n\nThink of this as an open forum for you to air any and all grievances that you may carry against her.\n\nI was flying on the second day, and when you caused the trash storm, I crashed into a rotting turkey carcass, and it exploded.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nAll this cartilage and bone got tangled up in my hair, and its skin was all over my skin.\n\nI didn't know where I ended and the turkey carcass began.\n\n\n\nWell, if it makes you feel any better, your skin looks amazing.\n\nMy caf\xe9 got destroyed by the giant frog, then I reopened it and it fell into the sinkhole.\n\nJust like me, I fell in too.\n\nWho else feels that Eleanor has ruined every moment of your existence since you arrived?\n\nExcellent. I must confer with Eleanor for a tick, so please, just enjoy the lemonade and cookies.\n\nIt seems everyone's problem with me is me.\n\nYes, it would appear that way.\n\nThe last moment they were happy was at my party.\n\nWe have to recreate that party.\n\nWe have to take them back to that night before I started affecting the neighborhood and give them a fresh start.\n\nYes, of course.\n\nWe must throw the perfect party, or else you'll be tortured by demons forever.\n\nThis will be the fourth most important party I have ever thrown.\n\nJanet, there you are.\n\nSome residents are complaining that you're not responding...\n\nI'm sorry, what's going on?\n\nIs that a... a wedding ring?\n\nYes.\n\nI'm married.\n\nTo whom?\n\nSorry, my protocol forbids me from telling you any private information about any resident.\n\nIs it that person?\n\nJianyu, the man standing right there also wearing a wedding band?\n\nDad... we need to talk.\n\n[tense music]\n\nI just want to make sure that I have this right.\n\nUm... Jianyu is not a Taiwanese monk, but rather someone named Jason Mendoza, a failed DJ from Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nI wasn't a failed DJ.\n\nI was pre-successful.\n\nAnd you two are married.\n\nHells yeah, homie. We love each other.\n\nShe makes the bass drop... in my heart.\n\nAnd Jason is a person who was near me, and then he asked me to marry him, and there is nothing in my protocol that specifically barred that from happening.\n\nSo I agreed.\n\nLove you too, babe.\n\nJanet.\n\nPlease tell me how this could have happened.\n\nUnclear. As you know, each time I am updated, I accrue new knowledge and abilities.\n\nMy suspicion is that when I was rebooted, I bonded with Jason in a way that I have never bonded with anyone before.\n\nI seem to have gained a new understanding of love.\n\nI also learned how to do this.\n\nI will speak to you later.\n\nGo to your void.\n\nOkay.\n\n[beep]\n\nNo, Janet, come back!\n\n[beep]\n\nHi there.\n\nGo.\n\nSure thing.\n\n[beep]\n\nNo!\n\nStop doing that.\n\n[beep]\n\nMe?\n\nGo!\n\nGood-bye.\n\nJanet, come back.\n\nI love you.\n\nI love you too.\n\n[quirky music]\n\nThat is Sachveer, and his problem with me is...\n\nOh, one of the giraffes tried to hump him.\n\n[laughs] It's gonna be hard to keep a straight face tonight.\n\nHey, can I ask your advice on something?\n\nAre you sure, dude?\n\nIsn't there someone else better you could ask, like literally anyone else?\n\nWell, it's a sensitive matter, and you... you do know me pretty well. So here it is: Real Eleanor said she loves me.\n\nHey, man, nice pull. She's a great person.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n\nI mean, we are soul mates, so I probably do love her, but then again, how do I know if my motivation is correct?\n\nMaybe I think I'm supposed to love her, but if I tell her that I love her for the wrong reasons, it won't mean anything.\n\nYou have a tendency to over-think things.\n\nTurn off that giant brain, and just say you love her too.\n\nYou think?\n\nIf this were some random person you hooked up with at a Diamondbacks game in the parking lot behind the port-a-potties... not based on a real example... I would say keep mulling, but this is your soul mate.\n\nShe's Universe-approved.\n\nTell her you love her.\n\n[beep]\n\nHey, your score just went up 20 points.\n\nYeah, 'cause I give great advice.\n\nNow maybe you'll finally listen to me and take off those glasses.\n\nWe are in the afterlife, dummy, nature's Lasik.\n\n\u266a\n\nOkay. I think I figured this out.\n\nThere is a real Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who took an oath of silence at the age of eight.\n\nBut, three months ago, he went into such a deep meditative state that he registered as dead, and when you died at that exact same moment, our system mistook you for him.\n\nPerhaps because you share the exact same IQ.\n\nCool.\n\nNo, not cool.\n\nHe stopped learning at the age of seven.\n\nOkay, so, now, this is sort of a quick litmus test, basic questions designed to tell whether you were fundamentally good or bad.\n\nNumber one: Did you ever commit a serious crime?\n\nYes, I blew up a guy's speedboat after he sued me.\n\n[ding] And...\n\nI stole an old lady's fake leg once on a dare.\n\n[ding]\n\nDid you ever have a personalized license plate?\n\nYeah, dawg.\n\n\"I LUV BUTTS\".\n\n[ding]\n\nHave... have you ever paid money to hear music performed by California funk rock band the Red Hot Chili Peppers?\n\nYo, the Chilis?\n\nI saw them in concert like 50 times.\n\n[ding]\n\nI once got arrested trying to steal Flea's bass guitar.\n\n[ding]\n\nOh, that was another serious crime I committed.\n\nI should have mentioned that earlier.\n\n[beep]\n\nIs it just me, or am I acing this test?\n\nOh, this is bad.\n\nOh, this is so, so bad.\n\nOh, I thought I had everything under control when I found Eleanor, but somehow you are... you're so much worse.\n\nNo, don't... don't touch...\n\nOh...\n\nHow does that still work?\n\nEverything's gonna be fine, homie.\n\nI promise.\n\n[light music]\n\nI don't know, B. What if it doesn't work?\n\nHey, we thought of everything except for an alibi and an escape route, but we'll figure it out as we go.\n\nYou don't wanna over-think these things.\n\nI'm kinda freaking out here.\n\nPillboi, I got you.\n\nThis plan is foolproof.\n\nAnd when it's over, we can finally have the lives we deserve.\n\n\u266a\n\nDiGiorno!\n\nI am a safe installer here to install-a da safe.\n\nSo just a-point to where the guacamole money is, and I'll-a install-a da safe-a in da, how you say, a-place?\n\n[phone dialing]\n\nYeah, hi, we're being robbed.\n\n\u266a\n\nJ, they're on to us, man.\n\nHis hat's a golf ball, and he's a got a terrible mustache.\n\nWe need to get married now.\n\nI do, for always and forever.\n\nI do!\n\nEleanor, for an utter novice, you have thrown a lovely party.\n\nWell, thanks, but it's not working.\n\nNot one more point.\n\nWhat the fork?\n\nOh, look, Michael's here. He can help.\n\nMichael, would you do us the honor of saying a few words?\n\nI don't know that I'm in the right frame of mind.\n\nPlease, they'll listen to you.\n\nJust pay me a few compliments.\n\nYou know, I'm great, heart of a champion, basically your muse, you get it.\n\n[party chatter]\n\nAttention, everyone.\n\nMichael would like to say a few words.\n\nHello, everyone. Good to see you all here, mingling around with your various secrets.\n\nWho really knows which of you are who you say you are?\n\n\n\nNo way to know unless I pull your skeletons out, right?\n\nOkay.\n\nTake her easy.\n\nYes, well said.\n\nNow, we shall hear from tonight's featured guest.\n\nShe's kind, she's humble, she's the Walmart of friends.\n\nDid I use that word right?\n\nEleanor Shellstrop.\n\n[sparse applause]\n\nHi, everyone, I'm Eleanor.\n\nOriginal flavor, not new and improved.\n\nI know a lot of bad stuff has happened because of me, but I never meant to hurt you, so if I caused you any harm, I'm truly sorry.\n\nThat's nice, Eleanor, but I still crashed into a turkey carcass.\n\nAnd I fell into a sinkhole.\n\nAnd my dog got kicked into the sun.\n\nWhat can you possibly say to us that'll make up for your actions?\n\nPobody's nerfect?\n\n[chuckles]\n\n[chuckling spreads]\n\n\"Pobody's nerfect\"? That's hilarious.\n\nLike \"nobody's perfect,\" but the letters switched.\n\nThat's very funny.\n\nIt's nerfect!\n\n[all laughing]\n\n[quirky music]\n\nEleanor, great job tonight.\n\nHave you checked the, uh, the ticker?\n\nI could really use some good news.\n\nOkay. [exhales]\n\nGah, come on.\n\nWell, the nightmare continues.\n\nThe nightmare continues.\n\nHow did this not work?\n\nThere's no way to increase my point total because everything I'm doing is out of self-preservation.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nMy motivation is corrupt.\n\nEven when I do nice things, I'm only doing them so I can get something out of it, the ability to stay here, which means none of this had any real moral value.\n\nIt doesn't count.\n\n\u266a\n\nHoly shirt.\n\nI know what I have to do.\n\nOkay, I am almost done with these personalized \"I'm sorry\" notes to everyone in the neighborhood.\n\nI need you guys to deliver everyone their notes, along with those T-shirts.\n\n\n\nWell, granted, these are hilarious, but how is this going to help?\n\nJust trust me.\n\nI'm gonna get the points.\n\n[quirky music]\n\n\u266a\n\nOh, good morning, Dad. Where you been?\n\nOh, just walking around, contemplating my failure, wishing for the sweet release of eternal extinction.\n\nCool.\n\nHey, um... why don't you want me to see Janet?\n\nI'm a good guy.\n\nAll I want is to give Janet the life she deserves.\n\nJanet is not built for human life, and I'm not sure you're much of a provider.\n\nDo you even remember how you died?\n\nNo, not really.\n\nIt's a little fuzzy.\n\nYou and your friend Pillboi were trying to rob a restaurant.\n\nPillboi!\n\nAnd then the cops showed up.\n\n\u266a\n\nSo the plan was to pretend to install a safe with your friend hiding inside it.\n\nHe pops out, steals the money from the restaurant, gets back in the safe, then you come in and uninstall it.\n\nI refuse to discuss my fifth amendment rights until I concur with your attorney.\n\nSure.\n\nLook, we found your buddy's plans.\n\nWe know he was the... brains.\n\nYou were just an accomplice.\n\nIf you're lucky, you might get probation.\n\nJason going to jail?\n\nNo, man.\n\nJason's dead. He suffocated in that safe.\n\nThere were no air holes.\n\nPlus he did a bunch of whippits while he was in there, which couldn't have helped.\n\nAt least he died doing what he loved... a bunch of whippits.\n\nNow he's never gonna get the life he truly deserved.\n\nEh, I think he got roughly what he deserved.\n\nI suffocated to death in... in a safe?\n\nI'm a moron.\n\nHey... hey, Janet?\n\n[beep]\n\nHi, there.\n\nJanet, you need to leave me.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou're the smartest girl in the world...\n\nI'm not a girl.\n\nAnd your dad is an angel.\n\nI mean, what a family.\n\nI'm just a dope who died in a safe with a snorkel... who's only now realizing why that didn't work.\n\nYou should be with someone better.\n\nI don't deserve you.\n\nJason, you are all that I care about, possibly because I did not have the capacity to care about anything before you.\n\nI love you.\n\nAlso, interesting sidenote, I think I might hate things now, too.\n\nSo far, it's genocide and leggings as pants.\n\nThis is nuts.\n\nJust weighing in over here.\n\nThis is bonkers.\n\nOkay, I have to go reboot Janet.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt's the only thing I can think of to do to get rid of this glitch.\n\nYo, who you calling a glitch?\n\nIt means \"error,\" Jason, which is what this is.\n\nOh, really? Is it an error to act unpredictably and behave in ways that run counter to how you were programmed to behave?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, you two sit tight.\n\nI'm gonna go m*rder Janet, and I'll be right back.\n\nLook on the bright side.\n\nWhen you're rebooted, I can teach you all the Dorito flavors again.\n\nNo. I'm not starting over.\n\nWhat if he reboots me, and we fall out of love?\n\nWe have to get out of here right now.\n\n\u266a\n\nWhere do you suppose she is?\n\nI hope she's okay.\n\nYou know, the more I work on her case, the more I think she truly belongs here.\n\nI'm... I'm sorry that I haven't been able to say... what you want me to say, because I-I do want to say it.\n\nWhat's holding you back?\n\nHonestly, my biggest fear is just making sure that my motivation for saying it...\n\nChidi?\n\n\u266a\n\nWow.\n\nHow did she suddenly...?\n\nHer motivation changed.\n\nShe couldn't earn enough points by apologizing to everyone here because she was only doing it to earn enough points to stay here.\n\nBut she did earn enough points, which means that she's decided not to stay here, which means...\n\nThat she's leaving.\n\n[tense music]\n\nOh, hey, Janet. I was just about to call you to ask you to get me a train to the Bad Place.\n\nWhoa, what?\n\nYou have to be a good person to stay here, and I can't become a good person unless I leave.\n\nYou don't belong here, Jason doesn't belong here, and now that I can think and feel, I don't belong here either.\n\nWhere are you going with this?\n\nThere is a woman named Mindy St. Clair who lives in a neutral zone by herself.\n\nIt's neither a Good Place nor a Bad Place.\n\nA Medium Place?\n\nDude, that's where I belong.\n\nI've been saying that since day one.\n\nIt's where Jason and I are going.\n\nWould you like to come with us to Mindy's house?\n\nYeah. Let's go hang with Mindy.\n\nThat sounds great. Love her, huge fan.\n\nCall the train.\n\nLook, there it is now.\n\n[brakes squealing]\n\nI did not call that train.\n\nThat train belongs to Shawn, the judge, who's coming here to judge you.\n\nCan you make that train go to Mindy's house?\n\nYep.\n\nThen we have to go right now.\n\nI just have to run home real quick and hit save on the Madden game I was playing because Blake Bortles has, like, 300 yards passing in the first half...\n\n[hissing]\n\n[tense music]\n\n\u266a\n\nShawn. Ooh.\n\nMichael.\n\nSorry I wasn't here to greet you. I, uh, had something I needed to tend to, but it can wait, it can wait.\n\n[beeping]\n\nOkay, I've hacked into the mainframe.\n\n[sighs]\n\nKidding.\n\n[laughs] I can't hack into the mainframe.\n\nTechnically, I am the mainframe.\n\nWould you just hurry up?\n\nI'm here to rule on the fate of Fake Eleanor Shellstrop.\n\nYes, yes, um, I think we have a rock solid case for Fake Eleanor.\n\nI truly believe she's a good person.\n\n[train chugging]\n\nAre you sure?\n\nBecause I believe she's stealing my train.\n\nI'm sorry, Michael.\n\nSorry, everyone.\n\n[quirky music]\n\n\u266a\n\nWell... not great for my case.\n    ]"},{number:12,title:"Mindy St. Claire",summary:"Eleanor Shellstrop arrives in the Good Place and meets her soulmate Chidi...",transcript:"[\u266a And now \u266a\n\u266a The end is near \u266a\n\u266a And so I face \u266a\n\u266a The final curtain \u266a\n\nOw!

I forgot.\n\nWe're going somewhere that's not the Good Place, and it's not the Bad Place.\n\nWe're going to a Medium Place.\n\nHmm, is there a 7-Eleven on the way?\n\n'Cause Janet's powers aren't working, and I want some gum and some football cards and some scratchy tickets.\n\nGo away from me.\n\nOkay.\n\nCan this train go any faster, Janet?\n\nNo pressure, but Jason and I will literally be tortured for all of eternity if we get caught.\n\nDon't worry, there's no way to tell we're going to Mindy St. Clair's house.\n\nIt'll be our sexy little secret.\n\nJason taught me about sexy things.\n\nOh, yeah? What things did he say were sexy?\n\nLamborghinis, cool snakes, spinning rims, 20,000 followers on Instagram, girls with pigtails eating lollipops, latex pants, Carl's Jr. ads, and sex.\n\nEh, some of those are right.\n\n\u266a\n\nI'm here to preside over case #00003 regarding the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop.\n\nThe Bad Place has sent Bad Janet to present their argument.\n\n[tone chimes]\n\nWhat up, ding-dongs? Yeah, so basically, um, the Fake Eleanor's a dirt bag, and these jabronis are gonna try and claim she's less of a dirt bag now, but she just stole your train, and she still sucks bad.\n\nAnd she belongs with us. Oh, also, check this out.\n\n[farting]\n\nNailed it.\n\n[tone chimes]\n\nI've ruled the fart inadmissible as evidence.\n\nWhat I will consider is the recent development of Eleanor stealing my train.\n\nNow, hold on a second.\n\nShe stole your train to voluntarily go down to the Bad Place.\n\nShe was sacrificing herself because she is a wonderful, selfless...\n\n[crunching]\n\nNo, don't... oh!\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nI should have warned you.\n\nShawn only cares about cold hard facts.\n\nIf he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet.\n\n[suspenseful music]\n\n\u266a\n\n[crunching]\n\nFinally.\n\n[crunching]\n\nOh, come...\n\nWhat did he just say?\n\nOh, because you're all so perfect.\n\n[suspenseful music]\n\n\u266a\n\nWow.\n\nSo where does this Mindy St. Clair live?\n\nI don't know. I'm out of range of our neighborhood. I don't have any of my normal abilities here.\n\nPerfect. [sighs]\n\nWell, let's try this way.\n\nOoh, I've never had to walk before.\n\nThis is fun.\n\nNow I'm bored. Walking is dumb.\n\n[light music]\n\n\u266a\n\n[hawk screeches]\n\nWell, given that she's the only person in the neighborhood, I'm guessing this is the pl...\n\nOh! She's naked!\n\n[screams]\n\nOh, sorry!\n\n[screams]\n\n[yells]\n\n[screams]\n\n[yells]\n\nWho are you?\n\nI'm Janet.\n\nHello, Mindy. My name is Beadie.\n\nI'm from the Good Place, and welcome to your first day in the afterlife.\n\nWhat's up, idiot?\n\nSorry I'm late, babe. Hey, are you pregnant?\n\nThat's not possible.\n\nCongrats.\n\nYeah, so, Mindy, look. You mostly sucked, but then you did this one good thing.\n\nI mean, I still think we should get you...\n\nThey didn't, but neither did we.\n\nA compromise was made: the neighborhood you are in now by yourself.\n\nYou submitted a list of things you wanted; the Good Place provided those things.\n\nYeah, and the Bad Place made some modifications.\n\nWe got you your favorite beer.\n\nYeah, but it's always warm.\n\nOn your jukebox, you'll find every song ever sung.\n\nYeah, by The Eagles, and it's only the live versions.\n\nAlso, there's some spoken word poetry from William Shatner.\n\nIt's deeply terrible.\n\nYou get the idea. Welcome to eternal mediocrity.\n\nWelcome to the Medium Place.\n\nSo what's up?\n\nWhat's your deal? Are you single?\n\nWhat's going on?\n\n[static crackles]\n\nSorry about before. One of the perks of living alone is that I get to just walk around naked.\n\n[laughs] My kind of gal.\n\nAnd I gotta say, you keep it tight.\n\nOh, that is the nicest and only thing anyone has said to me in 30 years.\n\nSo tell us everything. I mean, what did you do to end up here?\n\nThat's kind of a long story.\n\nGonna need a drink or three.\n\nDefinitely my kind of gal.\n\nYou guys have fun. This is me and Janet's honeymoon, so we're gonna go try and figure out how to have sex.\n\nSo I was a hotshot corporate lawyer in the 1980s.\n\nI only cared about making money and doing cocaine.\n\nOne night, I had an epiphany, right?\n\nI needed to do something good with my life.\n\nSo I drew up plans for this foundation that would help kids all over the world, would advance human rights, revolutionize agriculture, and just improve every nation and every society in every possible way.\n\nYou were pretty coked-up, huh?\n\nOh, yeah, man, I was flying high. It was so awesome.\n\nBut... you're not gonna believe this...\n\nI followed through. Yeah, I woke up the next morning, I went straight to the bank, I withdrew my life savings, and I was gonna start that charity.\n\nGood for you!\n\nAnd then I immediately fell into subway tracks and was electrocuted by the third rail.\n\nOoh...\n\nHonestly, not the type of rail I thought was gonna k*ll me... [chuckles]\n\n'Cause I love cocaine. [laughs]\n\nDo you have any? I'm just... I shouldn't...\n\nDo you?\n\nNo.\n\nOh, yeah. I mean, I was just...\n\nI was just kidding. It was just a joke.\n\nI mean, who would want to do cocaine right now?\n\nAre you okay?\n\nAnyway, so after I died, uh, my sister found my plan, and she used my money to start the Mindy St. Clair Rescue Alliance, yeah.\n\nIt's actually the largest relief aid charity in the world.\n\nOh, so the question was, did you get credit for all those good person points or not?\n\nExactly. I don't know how long my case was pending or whatever, but when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time.\n\n[chuckles] Like a stripper over that last bump of coke at the party, if you know what I mean.\n\nBut anyway, they finally came to this compromise, you know?\n\nWell, it beats being tortured.\n\nI was about to turn myself in.\n\nNo. Yeah, there's no time for that morality nonsense, sweetheart.\n\nThis is about survival.\n\nYou gotta look out for number one.\n\nRight, well, we don't have proof that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's.\n\nEleanor, we've got a surprise for you.\n\nYeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake.\n\nOh, I know you've only worked here a few weeks, but we have this little office tradition where we all pitch in, and then we...\n\nYeah, no, I get it. It's just, I know what kind of cake I like. Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now. No, thanks.\n\nThis way, I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything. Later.\n\nWhat were we talking about?\n\nWhat is her deal? Why is she like this?\n\nI don't know, but the meaner she is, the more it turns me on. Is that weird?\n\nYou're my boss.\n\nOh, say that to me again, but more disgusted with me, like I'm a worm.\n\nEleanor was supposed to be in the Bad Place, arrived here by accident, assumed another person's identity, and has now escaped.\n\nIs that the whole story?\n\nWell, no. Someone else was sent here by mistake. His name is Jason Mendoza, and I believe he's on the train with Eleanor.\n\nYou knew about Jason?\n\nYes, I know that he's a fake and that he's married to Janet and that this entire neighborhood is...\n\nWhat's the human expression?\n\nAh, yes, a smokin' hot turd.\n\nI will deal with Jason Mendoza later.\n\nFor now, I will hear your arguments for why Fake Eleanor Shellstrop should stay in the Good Place.\n\nWe can do this, but we must remain emotionless.\n\nI'm talking \"Kristen Stewart on a red carpet\" level of emotionless here, all right?\n\nBegin.\n\n[deadpan] Eleanor dedicated herself to the study of ethics.\n\nI was blown away by her capacity for self-improvement.\n\n[deadpan] Eleanor is a magnificent person who has grown tremendously in her time here.\n\n[deadpan] Please, I'm begging you, please.\n\n[deadpan] Voluntarily heading to the Bad Place proves that she is a selfless person.\n\nSorry. I'm getting choked up.\n\nYes, voluntarily sacrificing herself and heading to the Bad Place would be a point in her favor.\n\nHowever, I've just received word that Eleanor is not currently in the Bad Place.\n\nWe have no idea where she is.\n\nWell, what the...\n\nWhat?\n\nFork!\n\n[crunching]\n\nI will now review Eleanor's memories.\n\nHer memories? As in, all the things she's done on Earth?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nBut perhaps we could take a little break first.\n\nYou know, we've been at it for a while, and you must be tired.\n\nI've been asleep in goo for the last 29 years, so I'm good.\n\nCall up the screen for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please.\n\nWhere should we begin, \"Waiters Screamed At\" or \"Cyberbullying of Pregnant Woman from Spin Class\"?\n\n[melancholy music]\n\n\u266a\n\n[door closes]\n\nHey, you wanna grab a drink or something?\n\nUh, no, I kind of have my own private time routine.\n\nI thought you'd want company after being here alone for so long.\n\nNo.\n\nOkay, I get it.\n\nHey, uh, where did you get that?\n\nThat's not one of my books.\n\nI only have Anne Rice vampire novels with water stains, and I've cut words out of most of them to make pornography.\n\nMy friend in the Good Place gave it to me when he was teaching me ethics. It reminds me of him.\n\nLook, if you wanna survive, you have to forget what you left behind. Take that whole experience, crumple it up, throw it in the garbage can.\n\n\n\nOkay. Instead of reading, I will\xa0\xa0watch\xa0this VHS copy of \"Cannonball Run II.\"\n\nOr maybe \"The Making of 'Cannonball Run II.'\"\n\nWow. Very medium.\n\nYeah.\n\nHey, you two lovebirds figure out how to have sex yet?\n\nNo. We tried for two hours, but there was just a lot of, like, bumping into each other.\n\nIt was weird.\n\n[speaking Spanish]\n\n[air horn blares]\n\nThis ain't your bar mitzvah anymore, b*tch.\n\nIt's my 24th birthday! What! Hot tiara, girl.\n\n[air horn blares]\n\nThat was \"The Crashing and Subsequent Destruction of Vanessa Garcia's Quincea\xf1era.\"\n\nLet's move on to another event.\n\n\"Heckling of Mall Santas\"?\n\n\"Lifetime Ban from Build-a-Bear Workshop\"?\n\n\"Brief Instagram Flirtation with Kid Rock\"? Oh, no.\n\nThis is getting away from us. We need to do something quickly.\n\n\n\nYeah, uh, Judge, request permission to speak somewhat emotionally?\n\nUgh. Fine.\n\nDramamine.\n\nHelps with the nausea. Proceed.\n\nOkay, look, I know, obviously, these memories aren't great.\n\nI was particularly disturbed by \"Started Fire in Mailbox to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt,\" but that was the\xa0old\xa0Eleanor. She changed.\n\nShe worked and she studied and she got better.\n\nAnd it wasn't just self-preservation, it was real self-improvement. I made the decision to help Eleanor that first week, and I'm glad I did.\n\nBecause she's worth it.\n\nI, too, helped Eleanor.\n\nNot as much as Chidi, surely, but my help was more friendship and sorely needed fashion advice.\n\nEleanor deserves to stay.\n\nThank you for these testimonials.\n\nA ruling has been reached.\n\nOh, you want to hear it.\n\nI forgot how needy humans are. [clears throat]\n\nEleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.\n\nThe progress she has made does not offset her actions on Earth.\n\nShe deserves to be in the Bad Place.\n\nOh!\n\nAs concerning Jason Mendoza, I have heard no statements nor seen any evidence to suggest... oh, he's from Florida?\n\nYeah, he belongs in the Bad Place.\n\nNo, but how do you intend to enforce this ruling?\n\nYou have no idea where they are.\n\nBad Janet?\n\n[tone chimes]\n\nWhat's up, fork nuts?\n\nEngage walkie-talkie protocol.\n\n[electronic warbling]\n\n\u266a\n\nWhat if you're here, and I'm like this?\n\nYes, that may work.\n\n[beeping, electronic blaring]\n\nWhoa, what is happening?\n\nIs she having an orgasm? Did I do it somehow?\n\nAttention Eleanor Shellstrop and Jason Mendoza.\n\nThis is the Almighty Judge on High of All Beings Living and Dead for All Eternity.\n\nMy name's Shawn.\n\nWe do not know where you are but hope you are receiving this message.\n\nYou have been found to be the rightful property of the Bad Place.\n\nEither return to your original neighborhood, or your accomplices Chidi Anagonye and Tahani Al-Jamil\xa0will go to the Bad Place in your stead.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhat?\n\nYou have four hours. Good-bye.\n\nYour Honor, please, Chidi and Tahani are completely innocent.\n\nThey are not completely innocent.\n\nThey told me so themselves.\n\nThey aided and abetted two criminals, one of whom was a DJ.\n\nThey're gonna send Chidi and Tahani to the Bad Place?\n\nWe're off the hook, this is amazing!\n\nBabe, we are going to be trying to make love all night long.\n\nWe don't have to go back, though. they just said.\n\nWe can't let Tahani and Chidi go to the Bad Place. They're our friends.\n\nWe literally owe it to them.\n\nIf they're really our \"friends,\" then why aren't they here with us right \"now\"?\n\nBecause\xa0we\xa0ran away. Are you...\n\nDoes your brain work, actually?\n\nDo you have a functioning head?\n\nI think he has a good point.\n\nI wouldn't go back for those turkeys.\n\nHow can you say that?\n\nThink practically here. Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in, you get sent to the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.\n\nOr you stay here, you're safe from the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.\n\n\n\nIt's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured.\n\nBut\xa0they\xa0do.\n\nThat's their problem.\n\nYour problem is whether\xa0you\xa0get tortured.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, it's my masturbating time.\n\nWhen isn't it? We're going back.\n\nBut...\n\nNow.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nCan we even make it there in time?\n\nI believe so, though it'll be close.\n\nWhere's Jason?\n\nHeads up!\n\nSorry, Eleanor, but I can't let us leave.\n\n[slow motion] Bortles!\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nNo!\n\n\u266a\n\n[clink]\n\nWhat are you doing, you goon?\n\nTrying to blow up the train.\n\nBlowing stuff up got me out of so many jams on Earth.\n\nLet me try again. Do... do you have another bottle?\n\n\n\nHi there, since there's no Janet here to serve you, I brought you two a little treat.\n\nAh, kind of like a last meal.\n\nNot like a last meal, just, uh, the final food you might ever eat.\n\nI'm gonna miss these little perks when I'm down in the Bad Place, being forced to wear a... a knock-off handbag and drink tap water.\n\nThat's what you think hell is?\n\nUgh.\n\nJanet, please, we have to go.\n\nI won't start the train until my husband says it's okay.\n\nI'm sorry, Eleanor, but I engaged a ride-or-die protocol so I'm loyal to Jason forever.\n\nBuddy...\n\nCome on, we gotta go.\n\nI don't wanna go to the Bad Place.\n\nIt's scary, like the movie \"Ratatouille.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nYo, I ain't trying to have rats living in my hat and pulling my hair to get me to do stuff.\n\nI'm scared too.\n\nBut we can't just abandon our friends and let them take the fall for us.\n\nSure we can. It would be so easy to do that.\n\nWe'd just go back to Mindy's house, chill out...\n\nI'd get used to room-temperature beer.\n\nMe and Janet keep trying to solve the problem of how to have sex, which could take years.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLet's just pretend that we didn't hear the Janet walkie-talkie message.\n\nNo, it's time to own up, dude.\n\nI spent my whole life acting like Mindy, me first, no matter what, and it literally took dying and being around a bunch of good people to realize that I was kind of a nightmare.\n\nWhy were you like that?\n\nWell... let me tell you about Doug and Donna Shellstrop.\n\nHey, Dad, just a warning, Mom's gonna be here in a second.\n\nUgh, your mother's coming? Oh, boy, hide the silverware.\n\nYou mean the silverware you stole from Mom?\n\nYeah, but she keeps trying to steal it back.\n\nI drove here as fast as I could.\n\nYou scored free WrestleMania tickets?\n\nThere are no tickets, Mom. I knew that was the only way I could get you here.\n\nAh-ha! Burn.\n\nEleanor, just because your father and I are divorced does not mean you can disrespect me like this, okay? We are a family.\n\nWhose birthday is it?\n\nMine.\n\nAre you serious? No way.\n\nThat was a B.S. foul on Chapman.\n\nAnd since you both forgot, again, which means you definitely didn't get me a present, again, I got myself something. I just need you to sign it.\n\nEmancipation papers? Honey!\n\nWhat does \"emancipation\" mean?\n\nIt means I'll be on my own.\n\nAll my life, I've been taking care of myself\xa0and\xa0you guys.\n\nI work two after-school jobs because you blew half my college fund bailing your boyfriend out of jail.\n\nSo irresponsible.\n\nAnd you blew the other half trying to frame her boyfriend.\n\nIt was so stupid.

My stomach hurts.\n\nThe point is, if she's going down there because of me, I'll never be at peace.\n\nYes! We get to stay, baby! We did it!\n\nNo, dude, this is bonkers.\n\nI am going. End of story.\n\nNo, I'm going. End of everything.\n\nWhat?

We get to stay, baby! We did it!\n\nLook, I love you and I think you love me.\n\nWe can be together, away from everyone else.\n\nObviously, we'll be miserable, but I truly believe our love will make us happy.\n\nOkay, you realize the Bad Place is not some sort of couples retreat, right?\n\nIf it is, Janet and I would like to go.\n\nI am going!

[chuckles]\n\n[door closes]\n\nReady when you are, boss.\n\nEleanor, what's going on?\n\nIt took me a while to figure it out, but just now as we were all fighting and yelling at each other and each one of us demanding we should go to the Bad Place, I thought to myself, \"Man, this is t*rture.\"\n\nAnd then it hit me.\n\nThey're never gonna call a train to take us to the Bad Place.\n\nThe can't, because we're already here.\n\nThis\xa0is the Bad Place.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\n[evil laugh]\n\nOh, man!\n\nI can't believe you figured it out.\n\n[laughs]\n\nOh, God!\n\nY-you ruined everything, you know that?\n\nOh, man.\n\nEleanor, you really suck!\n\n[gasps]\n\nI was so close to pulling it off!\n\n[groans, stammering]\n\n[sobs]\n\n[ceramic crunches]\n\nSorry. So she's right?\n\nYeah, she figured it out.\n\nNo, this doesn't make any sense.\n\nThis is paradise.\n\nOh, it looks like paradise, but it's actually a filthy dumpster full of our worst anxieties.\n\nI'm surrounded by people who are literally better than me.\n\nJust me being here forced Chidi into an ethical \"clusterfork.\"\n\n\n\nTahani tortured Jason by constantly trying to get him to talk, Jason tortured my because I was sure he would blow our cover, which was t*rture for Chidi, because he was responsible for me, which made Chidi seem like the perfect soul mate, and that tortured Tahani because he didn't love her.\n\nYou don't love me?\n\nPlease, don't ask me that right now.\n\nSee?\n\nWe've been torturing each other since the moment we arrived, and everything Michael has done has made at least one of us miserable.\n\nI had to be his assistant and try and find myself.\n\nHe convinced me to throw my life's work in the garbage.\n\nHe made sure I'd see those bogus neighborhood rankings because he knew I'd hate being second-to-last.\n\nAnd I had the perfect bud hole and no dudes to share it with.\n\nHe played us like a fiddle.\n\nYou gotta give it up.\n\nOh, dip!\n\nEleanor, I told you that first night that we were in a prank show.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nYou did! Great job, man.\n\n[laughs]\n\nChidi, don't go!\n\nI don't care if you don't love me, I love you.\n\nIt's the only thing that makes any sense to me in this crazy world, and I think we should stay...\n\nNo, stop, Vicky.\n\nThey figured it out.\n\nThey...\n\nThey know this is the Bad Place.\n\nEleanor figured it out.\n\n[groans] Man!\n\nThis was supposed to be my big moment.\n\nI just rehearsed that speech for, like, three hours.\n\nDamn it, Eleanor, you are the worst, and you can all suck it.\n\nDo you remember what I told you when you predicted you could do this for 1,000 years?\n\nThe time has come to innovate.\n\nThe human afterlife can be more fun.\n\nFor us, obviously, not for the people we're torturing.\n\nWho cares about those dummies?\n\n[laughter]\n\nI present to you the perfect recipe for my proposed experiment.\n\nFour people, perfectly suited to make each other miserable.\n\nI'm going to design an afterlife where they t*rture each other.\n\nWe've tried this.\n\nHumans are very reticent to t*rture each other.\n\nEven getting them to do simple things like pulling out each other's teeth is like...\n\nI can't think of the right analogy.\n\nWhat makes you think that you can get them to do this?\n\nBecause they won't even know that they are doing it.\n\nI'm going to make them think that they are in the Good Place, and to make sure that they drive each other insane, I will be there, posing as a Good Place architect.\n\nWhat?\n\nI even stole a Good Place Janet we can use.\n\nUgh!\n\nIt can work.\n\n[scoffs]\n\nLook, we can just send them all to the hot spike pits with the lava and the bees and the lightning that tears off their flesh.\n\nLet's try something new.\n\nToo many variables. Too many moving parts.\n\nThat's what will make it fun.\n\nI cannot predict everything that's gonna happen, but we'll improvise.\n\nWe'll... we'll be on our toes. It'll be exciting.\n\nI think that we can get them to t*rture each other... for 1,000 years.\n\nI think you'll be lucky to get six months out of this insane gambit.\n\nBut take me through it. How would this work, exactly?\n\nOh. Yes, all right, so... [clears throat]\n\nThis is a 14 million-point plan.\n\nUm... oh, sorry.\n\nI thought we reserved the conference room.\n\nNo, Todd, we have it until 3:00.\n\nSorry. Sorry, everyone.\n\nSo, Bambadjan and Gunnar and Shawn... everyone else in this neighborhood...\n\nExcept for you four, everyone in this neighborhood is one of us.\n\nAfter I came up with everyone's characters, we'd just create fun scenarios designed to t*rture you.\n\nHow can I be over it? We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.\n\nWell, it sounds like you've had a really nice vacation from your full-time job.\n\nGet your story straight.\n\nOkay.\n\nThey're at each other's throats already.\n\nThis should put them over the top.\n\nEd, you play Bart, a former private eye.\n\nOoh.\n\nTracy, you're his soul mate, Nina... a marriage counselor.\n\n[both laughing]\n\nMaybe we can get them to swing with us.\n\n[laughter]\n\nThat's perfect, perfect!\n\nShh, shh, shh.\n\nHey, guys? It's Michael!\n\n[groans]\n\nThat was really a fun time.\n\nThen it all started to go off the rails.\n\nWhen I confessed.\n\nYou had no idea I was gonna do that, because honestly, I had no idea I was gonna do that,\n\nYeah, that came out of nowhere.\n\nI mean, after that it was just a crazy scramble for all of us.\n\nYou know, I definitely underestimated how effective Chidi was gonna be, teaching you to be good, and obviously, we didn't anticipate that Janet would fall in love with Jason.\n\nHang on. That part is real.\n\nOh, yeah. Janet isn't one of us.\n\nNo, she's sort of a... foundational mainframe for all of the neighborhoods, good and bad.\n\nAnd apparently, this Janet is in love with Jason.\n\nI mean... [laughs] What a world, huh?\n\nWait, I don't get something.\n\nI know why Jason and I were sent here, but why Tahani?\n\nOh, yeah. Didn't you raise, like, $1,000 for charity, or whatever?\n\nUh, $60 billion, actually, so.\n\n[playful music]\n\nOh.\n\nBut it didn't matter... because my motivations were corrupt.\n\n\u266a\n\nI didn't care about helping the people I raised the money for.\n\nI just wanted to prove my parents wrong, stick it to my sister, get fame and attention.\n\nMy only real goal\xa0was to snog Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.\n\nWhich I did.\n\nCouple of times, actually.\n\nBut wait, why is Chidi here?\n\nWell, uh... there's something you don't know about me.\n\nI read an article saying that growing almonds was bad for the environment, and yet I continued to use almond milk in my coffee...\n\nNo, dingus!\n\nYou hurt everyone in your life with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.\n\n[playful music]\n\nOh, fork!\n\nYou're right.\n\nEvery friend, every girlfriend was driven nuts because I couldn't do anything.\n\nI missed my mom's back surgery\xa0because I had already promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him figure out his new phone.\n\nI made everyone miserable.\n\nWell, if it'll make you feel any better, you were the closest to actually getting in, up there.\n\nYou weren't that close. You were just the closest.\n\nThat makes me feel worse, somehow.\n\nGood. Thank you, Chidi.\n\nI really needed to hear that right now.\n\nI mean, all this hard work, all the planning, all for nothing.\n\nThis really sucks.\n\nNo, it doesn't.\n\nThis is wonderful.\n\nYou saw us all on Earth... a selfish ass, an idiot DJ, a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud with legs for days...\n\nSide note, I might legit be into Tahani.\n\nBut that's for another time.\n\nYou thought we would t*rture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other.\n\nWe improved each other, and the four of us became a team.\n\nSo, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.\n\nOh, Eleanor. That's it!\n\nMy big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.\n\nNext time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.\n\nUh, next time?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna erase your memories, you know, make a few changes and start over again.\n\nHopefully. Just gotta get the boss man to sign off.\n\nWish me luck.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nGuys, we need a plan. Quick.\n\nTahani, anything?\n\nChidi, I need ya. You're the smart one.\n\nI-I can't. I-I can't.\n\nJason?\n\nWhat? What's up?\n\nUgh!\n\nWhat do you say? Take two, huh?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI mean, what is this? All this work for four people, and me, I'm wearing a judge's robe?\n\nI feel like a real weenie.\n\nLook, for a first attempt it was actually very promising.\n\nLet me... let me just tinker a little, try again.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut you're way out on a limb here, Mike.\n\nIf this thing goes sideways again, you are done.\n\nGuys, he is going to erase our memories at any second and all of this will have been for nothing.\n\nUgh!

Love people's names and love learning all about them.\n\n- Where are you all from?\n- Well, oddly enough,\n\n- I was born in Mozambique...\n- Cool. Listen,\n\ndo you guys know if there's, like, a neighborhood phone book with everybody's name listed in it?\n\nOh, I don't think so, 'cause,\n\nI mean, there's no phones here. [laughs]\n\nThere are no phones here?\n\nOf course. Duh!\n\n[laughs] There's no use for 'em.\n\nI always prefer talking to people anyway.\n\nPeople... are like nature's apps.\n\nHuh. Anyway, we're on our way to get some pizza.\nWould you like to join us?\n\nMaybe we could get to know each other a little bit,\n\n- chat.\n- Uh, I'm good.\n\nI'm gonna explore a little bit.\n\nBut it was so nice to meet you Nina, and B...\n\nbye-bye.\n\n[uncomfortable string music]\n\nOh, sorry, I didn't see you.\n\nChidi? Are you Chidi?\n\n[otherworldly ringing music]\n\nEleanor? What are you up to?\n\nOh, hey there, Michael.\n\nJust getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.\n\n- Oh!\n- Who was that mysterious gentleman wearing the nightgown?\n\nOh, that's Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who never speaks.\n\nMight be a little hard to get to know him. [laughs]\n\n\n\nEleanor... you and I both know that you're not like everyone else in this neighborhood.\n\nEveryone here led a remarkable life.\n\nBut you... the work you did as an environmental activist was just extraordinary!\n\nAh... [chuckles] Well, it's the environment. I mean, I loved, um...\n\nmushrooms.\n\n- I can honestly say that.\n- Well, it paid off, because you were the number one point-getter in this entire neighborhood.\n\nAnd as such, I was just hoping that you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party.\n\nYou know, just to introduce yourself.\n\nHow can I say no? [laughs]\n\nCan I say no? It doesn't feel like I can say no. But if I can:\n\n- Michael, I'm saying no.\n- Okay,\n\nso, you'll speak for... maybe an hour or so?\n\nHey, you know what? I... got you a little something to wear here.\n\nNow, all the top point-getters wear these\n\n- on the first night.\n- [gasps quietly]\n\n[whispering] Oh, you gotta be forking kidding me.\n\nSo, long story short, my heart is in the Pope, my liver's in the Dalai Lama, and my teeth were strung into a necklace for a child king in French Polynesia.\n\nBut it got me into the Good Place,\n\n- so... can't complain.\n- Wow.\n\nCan I... tell you something,\n\n- just soul-mate to soul-mate?\n- Hold that thought.\n\n- I'm gonna head to the gym.\n- [laughs]\n\nOh, you're serious. Again? Right now?\n\nYeah. I'll catch you later!\n\nHey there, best person!\n\nYou must be Eleanor.\nI'm Jessica, the host.\n\n- Hi.\n- Michael told us all about your speech. I can't wait to hear\n\n- what you have to say.\n- Me neither, Jessica.\n\nMe. Neither.\n\nAw, don't be nervous. Here.\n\n- Liquid courage.\n- Actually, um... you know what?\n\nI think I need to keep a clear head.\n\nCan you imagine getting drunk before giving a big speech?\n\nGetting kicked out of your niece's christening, and then, only later, once you've sobered up, realize you don't even have a niece.\n\nIt's like, who was that kid?\n\n[chuckles nervously]\n\nSo, Eleanor, you were an environmental lawyer.\n\n- That's fascinating.\n- Yeah.\n\nI know. Just don't ask me any questions about it. I am so sick of describing exactly what it means.\n\nHey, I'm headed to the bar.\n\nCan I grab you something?\nHow about a margarita?\n\n- No, I'm good.\n- [stammers]\n\nActually, I'm the best... according to the sash.\n\nShe's still not drinking?\n\nNope. Something's off.\n\nShould we...\n\n- [makes chomping sounds]\n- No.\n\nKeep it together.\n\n[sighs] Ah, screw it.\n\nCouple of quick sh*ts... [gasps softly]\n\nAnd then I'm coming for you, shrimpies.\n\nPlease don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.\n\n[bright string music]\n\n\u266a\n\nThese are for you.\n\nDrink up.\n\nHi. Is your name Chidi?\n\n- Yes?\n- Ah! I knew you weren't a soup.\n\n- What?\n- Listen to me very carefully.\n\nMy name is Eleanor Shellstrop.\n\nWe need to talk.\n\n[rushing sound]\n\n[door clicks open]\n\nChidi? Come on in.\n\nSo there really is an afterlife.\n\nI can't wait to have breakfast with Kant, and lunch with Michel Foucault, and then have dinner with Kant again, so we can talk about what came up at breakfast.\n\nI'm sorry, Chidi... all the great philosophers in history... [inhales] ended up in the Bad Place.\n\nAll of my heroes are...\n\nBeing tortured. Yes, I'm afraid so.\n\nActually, it is kind of clever how they punish philosophers.\n\nEvery day, they make them go to school... naked, and then they take a test in a class they've never been to.\n\n[chuckles] And then they smash them with hammers.\n\nAnd that part is not so clever.\n\nBut the point is:\n\nChidi, you were way better than all of them.\n\nYou're safe.\n\n[pleasant music]\n\nNo way. Soul mates are real?\n\nThey sure are. Although, your soul-mate situation is a little unusual.\n\nOh, no. I don't have one, do I?\n\nThat's fine.\nI mean, who needs a soul mate, anyway? My soul mate will be...\n\n- books!\n- No, no, it's not that you don't have a soul mate, it's that you have multiple soul mates.\n\nHere. Now, normally, our omniscient system perfectly analyzes each person's profile, and then matches him or her with another person.\n\nBut in your case, the system matched you with two other people.\n\nIt's a rare occurrence, like... like a double rainbow, or someone on the Internet saying, \"You know what?\n\nYou've convinced me I was wrong.\"\n\nSo, how do you choose who I should be with?\n\nOh, I don't choose. You do, Chidi.\n\nI... [stammers] What?\n\nThis is Ang\xe9lique, Pedro, and Pevita.\n\nAccording to the system, either Pedro or Chidi could be matched perfectly with either Ang\xe9lique or Pevita.\n\nSo, figure it out. Should be fun.\n\nCool... beans. One second, guys.\n\n- Um, so, so, so...\n- Yeah?\n\nYeah, so... making decisions isn't necessarily\n\n- my strong suit.\n- I know that, buddy.\n\nYou... you once had a panic attack at a make-your-own-sundae bar.\n\nThere were too many toppings.\n\nAnd very early in the process you had to commit to a chocolate palate or a fruit palate, and if you couldn't decide, you wound up with kiwi-Junior-Mint-raisin, and it just ruins everyone's night.\n\nChidi, I am so sorry.\n\nI literally cannot choose for you.\n\nThis has to be your decision.\n\nBuddy, you gotta trust me.\n\nI would never place you... in a painful situation.\n\nRight. Um...\n\nYou ready, Chidi?\n\nHere you go, Chidi.\n\nOne slice of Hawaiian, straight out the oven for you.\n\nI'm Denise. Welcome to my pizza place.\n\n- Thanks, Denise.\n- And here's one for you.\n\n[dismissively] Have a nice day.\n\nIt's interesting that Hawaiian pizza is so popular here.\n\nYeah, I guess a lot of the residents here love it.\n\nKind of makes you wonder what type of pizza they have in the Bad Place, huh?\n\n[both laughing]\n\nSo, I can't believe you studied in Brisbane.\n\nWe must have just missed each other.\n\n- What was your thesis on?\n- Oh, gosh.\n\nIt was so boring. It was called, \"Cultural Relativism and Moral Absolutism:\n\n\"An Exploration of Values As Seen Through\n\n\"The Works of Alain LeRoy...\n\nboth: Locke and Immanuel Kant\"!\n\nShut up. You read it?\n\nNo, but that pairing is the most obvious pairing to employ in a paper with that title,\n\n- and I wanna read it so bad!\n- [laughing]\n\nWhat about Morocco?\n\nYou ever travel there?\n\n[sucks teeth]\n\nNo.\n\nWhat about anywhere else?\nYou been anywhere else?\n\nNo.\n\nSo, first impressions? Anyone?\n\nI kind of want to hear what Chidi thinks.\n\nWell. Um...\n\nI mean, you're both brilliant, accomplished women... and Pedro, you're great too.\n\nJust amazing people.\n\nI'm surrounded. Ahh! [laughs]\n\nBut, if I had to say... who I sort of immediately bonded to, on a gut level, I think I would say that I kind of feel like my soul mate is...\n\n- Ang\xe9l...\n- Wait, wait!\n\n[panting] There was a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWe had a four-hour time gap in your profiles on May , .\n\nI corrected that day's events for all of you, and ran the numbers again, and... the final result proves definitively that Pedro is Ang\xe9lique's soul mate, and Chidi, your soul mate is Pevita.\n\nThat was close. [laughs]\n\n[groans quietly]\n\nHey, you guys hadn't made a decision yet, had you?\n\nNo! We did not.\n\nNo one said anything.\nI didn't hear anything, and I certainly didn't say anything.\n\nThat's for darn sure. [chuckles]\n\n- [laughs]\n- [laughs]\n\n[both laughing]\n\n[scattered, fading chuckles]\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right. See you later.\n\n[classical music playing]\n\nThis is fun.\n\nIt's a fun party.\nThere's no question about it, this is a fun situation.\n\nHey, you guys are here.\nThe fun continues...\n\nnay, increases! [laughs]\n\nYou two look nice.\n\nThanks! And you look...\n\n[drawing out word] fine.\n\nWould I say you look better than anyone else here?\n\nNo, I wouldn't say that.\nDo you look bad?\n\nNo. But good?\n\nWould I go as far\n\nas to say that you look good?\n\nDoubtful. Hey, wine.\n\nMmm. Do I feel like red or white?\n\nOh, deep down in your heart of hearts, you probably already know which one you want.\n\nWhy isn't anyone talking?\n\nJanet, could you show me to the bar, please?\n\nMm-hmm!\n\nOh, hey! Chidi, right?\n\nDenise. We met earlier, remember?\n\nOh, yeah, hi. Are you limping?\n\nYeah, I am. Crazy story.\n\nSee, I was a trapeze artist in an illegal circus\n\n- in Bangladesh...\n- Ang\xe9lique.\n\nHey. How are you doing?\n\nOh, well, uh... [laughs]\n\nYou know. My stomach's in knots and I'm stress-grinding my teeth, and it feels like my soul is being suffocated.\n\nYou know, just your standard paradise stuff.\n\nHow about you?\n\nIt's been a little uncomfortable.\n\nI think Pedro maybe heard you say...\n\n- that thing you were gonna say.\n- Oh, no.\n\nI'm so sorry. I...\n\nBut I have to ask.\nDo you feel the way I feel?\n\n- We can't talk about this.\n- Well, I know, but if the numbers were that close, Ang\xe9lique, I think I'm supposed to...\n\nStop! Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.\n\n[bright string music]\n\nThese are for you.\n\nHi. Is your name Chidi?\n\n- Yes?\n- Ah!\n\nI knew you weren't a soup.\n\n- What?\n- Listen to me very carefully.\n\nMy name is Eleanor Shellstrop.\n\n- We need to talk.\n- About what?\n\nJust shut your mouth, smile at me, and walk over here.\n\nOkay, you're definitely my least favorite person...\n\n[in pain] I've met so far.\n\nOkay, I'm sorry, this is really not a good time.\n\nI'm right in the middle of something.\n\nDude, I'm guessing we have about seconds to talk\n\nbefore someone notices.\n\nWhen I got here, some robot lady appeared out of thin air and gave me this.\n\n- You mean Janet.\n- Oh, that's it! Janet.\n\n- Hi there.\n- Not now, Janet.\n\n- Buzz off.\n- Okay.\n\n- [short beep]\n- Now,\n\nI have no memory of writing this, but it is my handwriting.\n\nAnd that's your name, right?\n\nSo, for some reason, at some point, I put this note into... that whatever-lady's robot mouth.\n\n- You already forgot her name?\n- No, I didn't.\n\nHer name is...\n\n- Janet.\n- Hi there.\n\n- [gasps] Fork off!\n- Okay.\n\n- [short beep]\n- From the second I got here,\xa0these nerds have been acting real weird, trying to get me drunk.\n\nMy soul mate ditches me every time I try to talk to him, and this Zen-master guy gave me this magic bracelet thing, and then he just ran away.\n\nSomething very strange is going on here, and the only person I trust is me, and me told me to find you.\nSo... what's the deal?\n\nWhat's happening? What do you got?\n\nUh...\n\nI can't... [stammers, laughs]\n\nLook, I'm... I'm sorry, but none of this means anything to me, and I've got my own problems to deal with.\n\nI'm sorry, I can't help you.\n\nAttention, everyone!\n\n[glass ringing]\n\nSpeech time!\n\nI know you're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet, but if you are, please get me out of this speech.\n\n[rushing sound]\n\n[door clicks open]\n\nTahani. Come on in.\n\nYou're in the good place, Tahani.\n\nOoh, what a surprise! [laughs]\n\nBut yes, I accept.\n\nThis is your soul mate, Tom\xe1s.\n\nNow, Tom\xe1s was a doctor with the International Rescue Alliance, and you raised money that ultimately funded his medical missions.\nIt's just so perfect!\n\n- Aww.\n- It's lovely to meet you,\n\n- Tahani.\n- Charmed, I'm... short.\n\nI'm sorry, did I just say \"short\"?\n\nI-I meant to say \"charmed, I'm sure,\" of course, because I am charmed to meet you, it's just an unfortunate Freudian short. [giggles]\n\nShall we?\n\nSo, where did you attend medical short?\n\nSo, this is the living room... as well as the kitchen and the bedroom.\n\nIt's so... cozy. [laughs]\n\nI feel like the walls are just hugging me.\n\n- [laughs]\n- Michael, I don't mean to be rude, but this is simply absurd.\n\nYes, thank you.\n\nI didn't want to say anything, but...\n\nThere's only two of us, and we don't need all this space.\n\n- \"All this space\"?\n- Oh, of course.\n\nYou two humanitarians don't want anything so extravagant.\n\nI'll just get rid of the second floor.\n\n[magical ringing]\n\nOkay, I'll let you two have some alone time.\n\nI will see you at the party.\n\nWell... certainly is quite quaint.\n\nSo, it's just... fun. I daresay even quite charm...\n\nah, no.\n\n- What's the matter?\n- Sorry, it's just a... self-portrait\n\nof my... my sister. Wonderful.\n\nYour sister is Kamilah Al-Jamil?\n\nI used to play her music for my patients.\n\nAt times, it felt like Kamilah's songs were curing the malaria for us.\n\n[chuckling] Great.\n\nWell, I best be getting changed for tonight.\n\n- Mm.\n- Can hardly wear a day dress\n\n- to an evening event.\n- Sounds good.\n\nI'm ready whenever you are.\n\n- Is that... what you're wearing?\n- Oh, yeah.\n\nMy years treating remote villagers taught me to favor comfort over style.\n\nBut you should wear whatever you prefer.\n\nWell, I mean... as we are soul mates, perhaps...\n\nI-I should also... dress down.\n\n[classical music playing]\n\n\u266a\n\nYou all right, my dear?\n\n[chuckling] Yes, just not used to dressing like a plumber-ess.\n\nIs that what you call a female plumber, or is it a toilet sweep?\n\nOr clog wench?\n\n[laughing sadly] In any case, that's how I'm dressed.\n\nMy darling, you are in the Good Place.\n\nRelax. Feel the breeze on your feet.\n\nThat's why Crocs have holes in them.\n\nI'll get us a drink.\n\nLower that beautiful face for me, won't you?\n\n- Lower-lower-lower-lower-lower.\n- Okay.\n\nMuah!\n\nTahani? You all right?\n\nMichael, hello!\n\nYes, I'm having a splendid time.\n\nAlthough, if I'm being honest, a few aspects of my day have been... sub-optimal.\n\nReally? Like what?\n\n[sighing] Well, my house is a bit small, which is fine, it's just not what I'm used to, and Tom\xe1s is lovely, but we haven't really...\n\n\"clicked\" yet, to use a mundane colloquialism... which I suppose I should do, now that I'm wearing...\n\n[voice breaking] Cargo pants.\n\nTahani, it's very common to experience adjustment pains.\n\nBut the system matched you and Tom\xe1s, and the system is never wrong.\n\nBut guess what? This is the Good Place.\n\nIf you want your house to be larger, then just ask.\n\nDo you want something this big?\n\nOr maybe bigger, like the Taj Mahal.\n\nI know, I know. How about a moon?\n\nWould you like to live on your own private moon?\n\nNo, no, no. My house is wonderful.\n\nAnd really, it's so silly to want a bigger house of all things, here in paradise.\n\nSo no, no changes needed.\n\nOkay, all right.\nBut if you change your mind, just ask.\nBecause all the other residents are very happy, so it'll give me plenty of time to deal with whatever requests you make.\n\nNo demand is too... what's the word? Oh, \"frivolous.\"\n\nOkay?\n\nWow. That is rough.\n\nPlease don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.\n\n[bright string music]\n\nThese are for you. Drink up.\n\nOh... no, no, I...\n\n[laughing] Hey!\n\nTwinsies!\n\n- I'm sorry?\n- Look!\n\nCargo-pants buddies!\n\n[chortles]\nI bet we have a lot in common.\n\nI was a garbage man in Winnipeg.\nHow about you?\n\nOkay... [mouths word]\n\nCrocs also?!\n\n- [glass ringing]\n- Speech time!\n\nI know you're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet, but if you are, please get me out of this speech.\n\nI've asked our top point-getter, here, to say a few words.\n\nSo, take it away, Eleanor!\n\n[applause]\n\nThe dictionary defines \"best\"\n\n- as being...\n- [slurring] Oh, God, boring!\n\nI'd like to say a few words if nobody minds.\n\n[whispering] Thank you, wizard.\n\nI am Tahani. Tahani am me.\n\nAnd even though I wasn't the \"number one point-getter,\"\n\nI just wanted to welcome you all to the neighborhood.\n\nYou all look so beautiful tonight, with your regular-sized pockets and... regular-sized soul mates.\n\nOh, no offense, darling, wherever you are.\n\nProbably somewhere down there.\n\nWhy don't you try to ease her off the stage\n\n- and take over yourself?\n- The point is,\n\nwe're all good people, right?\n\nWe all did the right thing whenever we could.\n\nAnd that's why it's so nice to be here among you, in this massive house that I want.\n\nI want this house. Give it. [laughs]\n\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\nBut really, give me the house.\n\nHey there, hot stuff.\n\nCan I get you a cup of coffee?\n\nGet your hands off me!\n\nOh, you think you're better than I am, don't you, just 'cause you're wearing that.\n\nLook at that terrible placement and angle.\n\nIs this your first time ever wearing a sash?\n\nYeah, it is, but I think if we all just...\n\nWell... give it to me then! [shouts]\n\n[guests gasping]\n\nI got her off the stage.\n\n[rushing sound]\n\n[door clicks open]\n\nJianyu? Come on in.\n\n[pleasant music]\n\nBefore we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk\n\nwho kept a vow of silence.\n\nWould you prefer to remain silent here as well?\n\nEvery resident here in the Good Place has a soul mate.\n\nNow, some of the pairings are platonic, some are romantic, but what you have with your soul mate is unique.\n\nYou have a spiritual connection that transcends the physical realm.\n\nThis person's gonna be your best bud.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nJianyu, let me introduce you to your soul mate, Luang.\n\nHe is also a Buddhist monk, from the Lumbini zone of Nepal.\n\nYou and Luang share an identical soul... like binary stars, orbiting one another in a perfect, reflective harmony.\n\nYou won't ever have a single moment of loneliness, because you'll always be right next to each other... for eternity.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna let you two get acquainted.\n\nI'm sure you have a lot to not talk about.\n\n[laughs] Because...well, you get it, you get it.\n\n[ambling music]\n\n\u266a\n\n[sighs]\n\n\u266a\n\n[ominous music]\n\n\u266a\n\nOh... sorry, I didn't see you.\n\nChidi? Are you Chidi?\n\n[otherworldly ringing music]\n\n- Eleanor? What are you up to?\n- Oh, hey there, Michael.\n\nJust getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.\n\n- Ah.\n- Who was that mysterious...\n\n[pleasant music]\n\n\u266a\n\nHello, you beautiful spirits.\n\nCan I offer you two something to drink?\n\n- Janet!\n- Hi there.\n\nThis is Janet. Now, she can get you literally anything you want.\nAll you have to do is ask.\n\nOf course, you two won't ever want anything, because you're perfectly content.\n\nOh, I know. How about something special?\n\nJanet, two yak's milks, please.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n[short beeping]\n\n[short beep]\n\n\u266a\n\n- [glass ringing]\n- Speech time!\n\n- If we all just...\n- Well... give it to me!\n\n[shouts]\n\n[guests gasping]\n\nI got her off the stage.\n\nTahani?\n\n- Are you all right?\n- Yes, fine.\n\nNever better. Top of my game, actually.\n\nYou'll have to excuse me, 'cause I've got to go, so...\n\nOh, look! I've got some shrimp.\n\nIn one of my many, many cargo-pants pockets.\n\n[sobs]\n\nWhat the fork is happening?\n\n[rushing sound]\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\n- How's it going, boss-man?\n- Enough chit-chat.\n\nIs everything in place for version two?\n\nYup, I've thought of everything.\n\nI won't let you down.\n\nI was just hoping that you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party.\n\nYou know, just to introduce yourself.\n\nHow can I say no? [laughs]\n\nSo... cozy.\n\nI feel like the walls are just hugging me.\n\n[laughs]\n\n\n\nHow about something special? Janet.\n\nTwo yak's milks, please.\n\nWhy isn't anyone talking?\n\nJanet, could you show me to the bar, please?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nMichael, may I please speak with you privately?\n\nSure, sure.\n\nIt just feels like I used to be Real Eleanor,\n\n- and now I'm Denise.\n- Denise is a good part,\n\nwith a... a great backstory.\n\nYou run the best pizza place in the neighborhood.\n\nYou have a cat, and that's cool.\n\nI took this job because it seemed fun and different, and in the original version, I got to break Chidi's heart, like, times, and it was great. I mean, he was miserable.\n\nAnd now, Ang\xe9lique gets to t*rture him?\n\nAng\xe9lique is a hack.\n\nI can act circles around her!\n\nBut I have nothing to do!\n\nI am a Ferrari, okay?\n\nAnd you don't keep a Ferrari in the garage.\n\nI hear your concern.\n\nI do. And I promise you, there is a great arc coming for Denise the pizza lady\n\n- in about years or so.\n- [sighs]\n\nChidi is going to accidentally k*ll your cat.\n\nIt's gonna give you a great chance to shine.\n\nCan I just have something that makes me stand out?\n\nA mysterious past, or... a limp!\n\n- I want a limp.\n- This is supposed to be the Good Place. Why would...\n\nOkay, I... no, I hear you.\n\nI'll tell you what.\n\nGo nuts, all right? Limp your heart out.\n\nOh, hey! Chidi, right?\n\nHi. Are you limping?\n\n- How's it going?\n- [sighs]\n\nWe're having some trouble with Eleanor.\n\nShe's not engaging in conversation,\n\n- she's not drinking.\n- Eleanor's not drinking?\n\nShe brought a flask in the car during her driver's test!\n\nOkay, we need to keep things moving here.\n\nI'm about to make her talk for an hour.\n\nShe'll definitely end up insulting somebody.\n\n[glass ringing]\n\nSpeech time!\n\nWe're all good people, right?\n\nWe all did the right thing whenever we could.\n\n- If we all just...\n- Well... give it to me!\n\n[shouts]\n\n[guests gasping]\n\nTahani? Are you all right?\n\nYes, fine. Never better.\n\nYou'll have to excuse me, 'cause I've got to go.\n\n[mumbling discreetly]\n\n- What the fork, man?\n- I know that book.\n\nIs that some kind of nerd pick-up line?\n\nBecause it's only kind of working.\n\nNo... the note you showed me before.\n\nAll right, this is from a book called \"What We Owe to Each Other.\" I used to teach it.\n\nI was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.\n\n- All right, brag much?\n- No, I'm trying to help you.\n\n- Sorry. Okay.\n- I have never seen you before in my life, but I think... somehow, that we know each other.\n\n[soft music]\n\nThat definitely sounded like a pick-up line.\n\n- [sighs]\n- And I'm not\xa0not\xa0interested, but we need to figure this out first.\n\n- [groans softly]\n- It's not that bad, right?\n\nI mean, we got a drunken speech.\n\nThat's good.\n\nNo. It isn't.\n\nTahani gave the drunken speech instead of Eleanor.\n\nWe can't build a chaos sequence out of Tahani's speech, because she thinks she belongs here... ding-dong.\n\nOkay, we can still salvage this.\n\n- Where's Eleanor?\n- She's gone.\n\n- I can't find her anywhere.\n- Maybe she left with Chidi?\n\n- He's gone too.\n- What?\n\nOr maybe she left with Jason.\n\nYou lost Jason?\nHow is that even possible?\n\nYou're only job is to stand next to that idiot.\n\nI got distracted by the fire!\n\nI love fire.\n\nYou know, my main job is to burn people with fire.\n\n- What's up, guys?\n- What are you doing here?\n\n- Why aren't you with Eleanor?\n- Oh, I told her\n\nI was going to the gym again.\n\nWhy would you say that in the middle of a party?\n\n- You told me too.\n- No, I didn't.\n\nYou said that if Eleanor tries to confess that she doesn't belong here, find a reason to avoid her, like saying, \"I'm going to the gym,\" so that's what I've been saying.\n\nThat was a suggestion of the type of thing you could say!\n\nDon't...\n\nHow many times have you specifically told her you were going to the gym?\n\nFive.\n\n- No, nine.\n- You dimwit!\n\nHey, man! I was perfectly happy in my old job in the twisting department.\n\nPeople came in, and I twist them until they snapped in half, and I move on to the next one.\n\nBut this job... is weird!\n\nIt's all talk, no twisting.\n\nSo if you don't like the way I do it, get somebody else. I'm going to the gym!\n\nFine. Yeah, you do that.\n\nYou go to the gym.\n\nOkay, we can still pull this off, we just need to find the four humans.\n\nOkay? Okay.\n\n[chuckles] Right now.\n\nEveryone in this room, find those four humans!\n\nAre you gonna talk, or just walk around like a nerd trying to get a personal best on his Fitbit?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm trying to process a tremendous amount of insane information.\n\nI mean, you're not supposed to be here, but you and I clearly met here, somehow, before now. I mean... does that mean that I'm not supposed to be here?\n\nI don't know, dude.\n\nWere you a good person on earth?\n\nI... I think so.\nI spent my life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the uni...\n\n[gasps] Oh, no!\n\nI used almond milk in my coffee, even though I knew about the negative environmental impact.\n\n- What?\n- Eleanor, what do we do?\n\nI don't know, dude!\n\nBut we better figure it out soon, or we're doomed.\n\n[sneaky music]\n\n\u266a\n\n- Uh, Janet?\n- [short beep]\n\n- Hi there, Jianyu.\n- Hi, Janet!\n\nUm, can I tell you something?\n\n- Sure.\n- I'm not Jianyu.\n\nAnd I'm not a silent monk.\n\nMy real name is Jason.\nAnd I don't know what's going on.\n\nI got here and Michael said I'm a monk, and he told me I was gonna have a new best friend, and that we were gonna live in a yogurt.\n\n- A yurt.\n- Oh, yeah, \"yurt\" for short.\n\nI was psyched to meet my new best friend, but he turned out to be this weird silent guy that won't leave me alone.\n\nI don't wanna go back to my yogurt.\n\n- Can I go to your house?\n- I don't have a house, Jason.\n\nI live in a boundless void.\n\n- Can I go there?\n- No.\n\nIt's a boundless void.\n\n- Okay.\n- So, what you're saying is, there are certain aspects of your existence here in the Good Place that are confusing for you, and you're searching for someplace to go where you feel less lonely.\n\nI know somewhere you could go.\n\n- Why did you do that?\n- Because you were nice to me.\n\n- You're my friend.\n- Okay!\n\nOkay!\n\nOkay, so, if we got all the way to Scanlon, we must have been studying very intensely for a very long time.\nOr, you grabbed a random book of mine and just tore a page out.\n\nI'm gonna be honest, that sounds more like me.\n\n[knocking at door]\n\nAh! Eleanor and Chidi.\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise.\n\nI'm so happy you two have met.\n\nI'm just going door-to-door, apologizing for the commotion earlier tonight.\n\n- Ah.\n- The first night in the afterlife can be a little overwhelming.\n\nDon't worry about us, Michael.\nWe are doing just fine.\n\nOh, good, good. Glad to hear that.\n\nWell, it's getting late.\n\nChidi, allow me to escort you back to your house.\n\n- Um...\n- Uh, hello, all.\n\nSorry for the late hour, Eleanor.\n\nI wanted to stop by and give you back your sash.\n\nThat's okay. You can just keep it.\n\nNo! I don't deserve it.\n\nI made a complete fool of myself tonight.\n\nI interrupted your big speech, badly stained my cargo pants, which, I have to admit, are quite comfortable.\n\nOh, God, what's happened to me?\n\nI'm praising off-the-rack separates!\n\nTahani, please. It's late.\n\n- I think what we should do...\n- No.\n\nLook, ever since I got here it feels like something's been off.\n\nTahani. There you are.\n\nI've been worried sick about you.\n\nThat's her soul mate?\n\nIs there a second one of him that stands on his shoulders?\n\nChidi! There you are.\n\nI've been worried sick about you.\n\nOkay... all right, everybody.\n\nNow we are really imposing on Eleanor here.\n\nChidi, let's everybody take off...\n\nHi, Eleanor. This person would like to speak with you... privately.\n\nAbout something.\n\nOh, really?\n\n- Yup. Bye!\n- [short beep]\n\n[whispering] This is the wise monk who gave me the magic amulet.\n\nI gotta figure out what it means.\n\nCould be the key to this entire mystery.\n\nLuang, perfect.\n\nWhy don't you take Jianyu back to your yurt,\n\n- right away.\n- Homey, no!\n\nI'm not spending another second with this loser.\n\nYou said he was gonna be my best friend, but he is not.\n\nMy best friend from Jacksonville was named Pillboi, and he was dope!\n\nWe would talk together, get high together, throw old batteries at drones together.\n\nBut this guy can't hold a camel to Pillboi.\n\nOkay, I no longer think he's a wise monk, and I'm pretty sure this is just a piece of garbage.\n\nBabe, there you are.\nI've been worried...\n\nLet me stop you. Can I guess?\n\nYou've been worried sick about me.\n\nI'm headed to the gym.\n\nSure, why not?\n\n- I'm quite confused.\n- Let me explain, gorgeous.\n\nI don't know what this place is, but it is certainly not the Good Place.\n\nMichael is forking with us.\n\n- Like a prank show.\n- Yeah, like a prank show.\n\nExcept according to this note, it's a prank show we've all been on before.\n\n- What note?\n- Apparently, I wrote myself a note, and stuck it in that Jackie lady's mouth.\n\nJanet. Her name is Janet.\n\n- Oh, right, Janet.\n- Hi there.\n\n- Hi Janet!\n- Hi Jason.\n\n[cackling]\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nEleanor Shellstrop, you sneaky little so-and-so.\n\nThat was some very quick thinking.\n\nI'm extremely impressed.\n\nAnd to be honest... I'm relieved.\n\nAt least there's an explanation for why this all went south so fast.\n\nBut you're not gonna\nbe so lucky next time.\n\n- Next time?\n- What?\n\n- Yeah. [laughs]\n- He's gonna do it again!\n\nThat's not gonna work this time...\n\n- dummy.\n- Okay, excuse me.\n\nI'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.\n\nI demand to speak to your superior.\n\nI am so sorry, madam. Please forgive me.\n\nWell, as humans like to say, third time's the charm, right?\n\n[employees grumbling]\n\nI take full responsibility for the false start.\n\nBut I assure you all, there is no note this time.\n\nI'll prove it to you. Janet!\n\n- [short beep]\n- Hi there.\n\nHi, Janet. Open your mouth please.\n\nThank you.\n\n[skin squelching]\n\nSee, no notes. No clues or loopholes... nothing in there!\n\nThank you, Janet.\nSo, let's all just pretend\n\nthe last attempt never even happened.\n\n- Questions.\n- Maybe it's none\n\nof our business, but did you tell Shawn\n\n- what happened?\n- Yes, I did.\n\nAnd he completely understood.\n\n[chuckling] As a matter of fact, he found the whole thing kind of funny.\n\nBut he was very supportive, and he says he's very excited for us to get going again.\n\nSo, anyone else?\n\nAnybody?\n\nNo? Then let's get out there and make some miseries!\n\nTesting, one, two, three...\n\n[digital beeping]\n\n- Hey there, boss-man.\n- You were supposed to call me\n\n- this morning, give me an update.\n- Oh.\n\n[laughs] Right, sorry.\n\nYeah, it's just the... the chaos sequence was going so well... better than the first time, in my opinion.\n\nEleanor got completely drunk last night.\n\nShe talked for, like, an hour.\n\nYou know, even flashed somebody, so we had a lot to work with.\n\nSo, attempt number two is on track so far?\n\nOh, smooth as silk. Everything's great.\n\n- [tortured screaming]\n- Oh!\n\nSounds like everything's going well back there too.\n\nWe're trying out the new butthole spiders.\n\n- Ah!\n- They're enormous.\n\nYou know, good old-fashioned t*rture...\n\nthe way it's supposed to be.\n\nGood luck with attempt number two.\n\nAnd remember,\n\nthere will be no attempt number three.\n\n[digital beeping]\n\n[tense string music]\n\nEleanor.

Jason?\n\nWho is Jason?\n\nI am a monk.\n\nYou know what...\n\nCan I talk to you for a second?\n\nI'm in a tight spot, and I could use someone to bounce some ideas off of, okay?\n\nOh, yeah, real quick, you're really in the Bad Place, and you're being tortured.\n\nWhat?\n\nI know it says here that we already tried throwing Tahani under the bus, but maybe we should revisit that.\n\nThrow her a little bit harder.\n\nMaybe under a bigger bus.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI think this is pointless.\n\nWe're trapped in a warped version of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.\n\nOh, cool, more philosophy.\n\nThat'll help us.\n\nWell, don't you see the problem?\n\nWe are experiencing karma, but we can't learn from our mistakes, because our memories keep getting erased.\n\nIt's an epistemological nightmare.\n\nUgh, even your nightmares are boring.\n\nYou... you are so mean, Eleanor.\n\nYou're just like those childhood bullies who said I would never get tenure.\n\nAnd you are so irritating!\n\nIn one of these reboots, I probably strangled you and then went to the Even Worse Place, but you know what?\n\nI bet it was worth it.\n\nOh, nice.\n\nUgh!\n\nSorry, can I just vent to you for a second?\n\nChidi is so annoying.\n\nI just...\n\nI cannot believe that he is the one I'm stuck here with.\n\nUh-huh, wow, crazy.\n\nOh, sorry.\n\nJeez, man, I thought you could be human for, like, two seconds and listen to me.\n\nI have, Eleanor.\n\nI have listened to you talk about Chidi times in different ways.\n\nLet me just cut to the chase.\n\nYou two, you got it bad for each other.\n\nNo, we don't.\n\nChidi's just a friend.\n\nWhat am I saying?\n\nHe's not even a friend.\n\nHe's just a weird teacher that I hate.\n\nDude, I do not want to\xa0\xa0watch\xa0\"Cannonball Run \" right now.\n\nAll right, what happened in the first one, so I'm all caught up?\n\nI don't know what's gonna happen to us,\n\nbut I need to tell you something.\n\nI love you.\n\nAnd you don't need to respond 'cause I know\n\nyou have trouble saying how you feel...\n\n- I love you too.\n\n- [scoffs] Very funny, but that... that's obviously not real.\n\nOh, that's real, baby.\n\nThat's real nasty.\n\nYeah, this was, like, the sixth time you guys were here.\n\nI saw you getting sexy the previous three times, so I cut a little hole in the wall so I could tape you.\n\nCall it my lookin' hole.\n\nIs that a camera?\n\nMindy, you pervert!\n\nHow many times have Chidi and I slept together?\n\ndifferent days, but, like, different sessions.\n\nAnd how many times did we say... that stuff?\n\nOh, only once.\n\nOh, God, I hated it.\n\nIt, like, really k*lled the vibe for me.\n\nSee, after I watch the porno I made starring you, I watch you talk about your feelings to cool down.\n\nIt's, like, anti-porn.\n\nI've only ever said \"I love you\" to two men my entire life, Stone Cold Steve Austin and a guy in a dark club who I mistook for Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\nI mean, why would you show me that?\n\nI don't know.\n\nYou guys are, like, trapped here together.\n\nI feel bad.\n\nYou know, I'm rooting for you guys.\n\nNo, there is no \"us guys.\" We basically just met each other.\n\nNo, Eleanor.\n\nYou guys have known each other a really long time.\n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if I told you that or not, because when Michael finds out he's failed again, he'll just reboot you.\n\nChidi, Janet, we're leaving.\n\nI am taking this with me.\n\n[deadpan] Oh, no.\n\nIt's my only copy.\n\nDon't.\n\nHow did it come to this?\n\nI was just trying to do something innovative and different that would improve the way we make humans' lives miserable for eternity.\n\nMm, well...\n\nShut up.\n\nWhat are my options?\n\nDo I have any?\n\nI mean, I can't go along with her plan.\n\nIt'll be a spectacular failure.\n\nBut I can't ignore her or she'll rat me out to Shawn.\n\nI'm trapped.\n\nYou're saying a lot of words right now, and I only know some of them, like \"rat\" and \"Jason,\" but I know a little wisdom I can give you.\n\nI know everything that happened in your life, and it was all stupid, so I highly doubt that.\n\nI was a member of a -person dance crew in Jacksonville.\n\nWe were called Dance Dance Resolution: We Resolve To Dance.\n\nOne day, Donkey Doug and I got into a fight because I'd framed his girlfriend for boogie board theft, so he started a new dance crew called Hashtag DougLife and immediately challenged us to a dance-off.\n\nHe said, \"Meet us inside the abandoned orange juice factory at midnight.\" That night, as the clock struck : , me and my crew came together with a determination we had never shown before and slashed all their tires.\n\nIt was dope.\n\nThe end.\n\nBy Jason Mendoza.\n\nYou know, that inane story actually contains a bit of good advice.\n\nThank you, Jason.\n\nYou got it, homey.\n\nI give good advice.\n\nGuess that's why I'm in the Good Place.\n\n[quirky upbeat music]\n\nOh, there you guys are.\n\nNo, stop, no more lies.\n\nJason, get over here.\n\nThat's right.\n\nWe know his name is Jason, not Jianyu.\n\nWe know everything.\n\nI don't understand much of it, but, yeah, I know it.\n\nYour sick t*rture plan is not working, okay?\n\n'Cause we keep figuring out your little puzzle.\n\nWe're winning, which means you're losing.\n\nSo you have two choices here, buddy: keep failing over and over or realize we're actually the ones with all the power here.\n\nYeah, no, uh...\n\nWe're on the same page.\n\n- What?\n\n- I want to team up with you guys.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhy?\n\nYou do?\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm in a bit of a bind, and I could use some backup, or as Jason put it, um, I need a new dance crew.\n\nSo what do you say?\n\nNew best friends?\n\nStop it.\n

New best friends?\n\nYou wanna team up?\nYou've been torturing us\n\n- and lying about it.\n- Let's not get\n\nall caught up on who lied to who\n\nor which one of us created an entire fake reality\n\nin order to cause eternal misery for the others.\n\nThat's ancient history.\n\nIt was happening until seconds ago.\n\nThe point is that...\n\ncircumstances have changed.\n\nAnd now, all of us teaming up is our best option.\n\nI love being on teams.\nOh, we need a team name.\n\nUm... the Bobcats.\n\n- Great.\n- Slow down, ding dong.\n\nHe wouldn't offer us a deal for no reason.\n\nHe needs us.\n\n- Why?\n- Because, as you said,\n\nyou keep beating me.\n\nLook, I built this neighborhood\n\nas a way to t*rture the four of you... psychologically...\n\nfor thousands of years.\n\nAnd you keep figuring it out\n\nand taking all the fun out of it.\n\n- Fun?\n- Today, there was\n\na new development that really chapped my nips.\n\nOne of my employees is blackmailing me.\n\nVicky.

Do not talk again for hours.\n\n- What do we do?\n- We team up with Michael.\n\nOkay, hot take, but I like your confidence.\n\n- Tell me why.\n- He has a bow tie.\n\nOh, no.\n\nI always trust dudes in bow ties.\n\nOnce, this guy in a bow tie came up to me\n\nat the g*n range in a Jacksonville bus station\n\nand said he'd give me $\n\nif I put these weird turtles in my duffle bag\n\nand brought them to Daytona Beach.\n\nSo I hotwired a swamp boat to Daytona\n\nand the guy paid me the $ .\n\nMy point is, you always trust dudes in bow ties.\n\n[grunts]\n\nAhh!\n\nLook, Michael's a liar.\n\nI know liars.\n\nIt was my job to trick people\n\ninto buying fake medicine\n\nand I was the top salesperson\n\n- seven years in a row.\n- I thought you only\n\n- worked there five years.\n- Proves my point!\n\nThis is a trick.\n\n- There's no way we trust him.\n- I agree.\n\nHe could be lying about this whole thing.\n\nFor all we know, you three are in\n\nthe Bad Place and I'm up in the Good Place,\n\nwhere I belong, being tested.\n\n- How would that even...\n- I don't know,\n\n- but it's possible.\n- Before we do anything,\n\nwe need more information.\n\nWe should ask him every question we can think of.\n\n- Yes.\n- Yes, we shall grill him\n\nlike the flank of a Niberian piglet.\n\nI'm sorry, has it been hours?\n\n[bell dings]\n\nOkay, man. We got questions.\n\nFirst off, how can we possibly trust you?\n\nYou can't.

Hey, Janet?\n\n- Hi, there.\n- Do you have something shiny\n\nJason can play with?\n\n[gasps]\n\nHow many different versions of this place\n\nhave we been through?\n\nUh, let's see. .\n\nThe longest one was months.\n\nUh, this current one has only been going for one week.\n\nBoy, you guys barely know each other.\n\nIt's gonna make this tough.\n\nWhat's that super tiny line?\n\nThat's the shortest one, eight seconds.\n\nIt was a butt reboot. I sat on the activator by mistake.\n\nMichael, was I also rebooted times?\n\nYes. Why?\n\nEvery time a Janet is rebooted,\n\nshe increases her social awareness and abilities.\n\nI might be the most advanced Janet in the universe.\n\nSo Janet isn't with you.\n\nNo. There has to be a Janet in every neighborhood,\n\ngood and bad.\n\nThis one is an actual Good Place Janet\n\nthat I stole to help sell the ruse.\n\nI guess it didn't work, though.\n\nBecause you keep failing.\n\n- Yes, thank you.\n- You're welcome.\n\nIf you're not human, why do you look like us?\n\nEveryone in the Bad Place Bureau of Human Affairs\n\ngets randomly assigned a human body\n\nso we can get the feel of how best to t*rture you.\n\nI gotta say, it took me a long time to get used to\n\n- the hanging bits.\n- Gross.\n\nOh, get your mind out of the gutter, Eleanor.\n\nI was talking about my testicles.\n\nMindy St. Clair's is fake, I bet.\n\nNo, the Medium Place is real.\n\nSo annoying how you managed to slip away from me\n\n- all those times.\n- Why even tell us\n\nabout any real thing?\n\nWhy not just lie about all of it?\n\nLies are always more convincing\n\nwhen they're closer to the truth.\n\nThat's true. I crashed a lot\n\nof open bar weddings as Eileen Shelbourne.\n\nEven dated a groomsman for a few months.\n\nSo I had to keep the name, and he got Eileen\n\n- tattooed on his neck.\n- Seriously?!\n\nHow are she and I in the same place?\n\n- Oh, get over yourself.\n- Trust me, don't trust me,\n\nit doesn't matter.\n\nWe're running out of time,\n\nand I'm your only option.\n\nWe're running out of time\n\nand I'm your only option?\n\nA lot of guys your age said that to me\n\njust as the bar was about to close.\n\nBut I never settled for them.\n\nBecause my ex-boyfriend lived nearby,\n\nhe was obsessed with me and he never slept\n\nbecause he was addicted to Adderall.\n\nThere is always another option.\n\nYou guys do whatever you want.\n\n- I'm out.\n- No!\n\nMy plan only works if all four of you\n\n- are on board.\n- Then you better get cracking\n\non a new plan, pally, because so far,\n\nI haven't heard a single good reason\n\nwhy I should help you.\n\nAll right, how about this? You help me\n\ntrick Vicky and all those other g*ons,\n\nI can get you to the real Good Place.\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nThere's a way to get to the real Good place.\n\nIt's complicated.\n\nIt may take a while to arrange...\n\nespecially since I'll have to do it in secret...\n\nbut yes, yes, there is a potential\n\nmethod of transportation.\n\nWait, is it nice?\n\nIs there a business class?\n\nCan I pre-board?\n\nYeah, let's not worry about that right now.\n\nI can get us there.\n\nUs?\n\nYou, Mr. Diabolical t*rture Guy\n\nare gonna try to join us in the Good Place?\n\nYeah, if I stay in the Bad Place, I'm doomed.\n\nBut if I rescue four pitiful, foul-smelling humans\n\nfrom eternal damnation...\n\nhit 'em with the big puppy dog eyes.\n\nPlease, sir, take pity on me, I've changed...\n\nand all that crap,\n\nmaybe I can earn a spot, too.\n\nWe didn't deserve the Good Place\n\nbased on our time on Earth.\n\nWill they even let us stay?\n\nI gotta be honest, I have no idea.\n\nBut at least if you help me fool Vicky,\n\nyour brains don't get erased every two weeks.\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nOkay, all humans who have not already been\n\nsuckered by Michael, another team meeting.\n\nThis is definitely a trap.\n\nWe figured out his game every time\n\nand now he's just trying a new way to mess with us.\n\nTeaming up with a demon is insane.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut I think we have to do it.\n\nAre you forking kidding me right now?\n\nYou take a half an hour to pick out a turtleneck,\n\nand yet this you're sure about?\n\nOkay, look, I spent my whole life trying\n\nto learn about right and wrong\n\nand apparently, I failed.\n\nI want us to get better and I want us to stay that way.\n\nYou understand that, right, Tahani?\n\nI understand nothing.\n\nHey! Same here!\n\nMichael, there's been a mistake.\n\nI belong in the Good Place.\n\nThe real one with the good people.\n\nWho do I speak to about correcting this?\n\nMe and you're wrong.\n\nVery well. I would like to speak to your manager.\n\nListen, sweetheart,\n\nyou've only been in this timeline for about a week.\n\nSo I think I'm gonna fast forward things a bit.\n\nThere's a very good reason why you ended up here.\n\nYou never cared about the people you were helping.\n\nYou did it only for fame or status or to spite your family.\n\nThat is utter tosh!\n\nI had my flaws, just like anyone else,\n\nbut I raised billions for charity.\n\nI was a good person and I defy you\n\nor anyone else to prove otherwise.\n\nYou know, in all the reboots,\n\nI never showed you how you died.\n\nI was saving it in case I ever needed\n\nto really make you miserable.\n\nBut it's hilarious.\n\nOf course, I mean sad.\n\nBut it might help you come to grips\n\nwith who you really were.\n\nDo you want to remember it?\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nTahani Al-Jamil, social activist,\n\nphilanthropist, neck model and now cover girl\n\nfor \"International Sophisticate Magazine.\"\n\n- Tahani, welcome.\n- Oh, it's such an honor.\n\nI have long dreamt of being one of the women\n\nor yachts who grace your cover.\n\nLet's begin with your sister, Kamilah.\n\nA woman who... as you know... was offered the spot\n\non our cover, but turned it down.\n\nI actually didn't know that.\n\nPlease, carry on.\n\nWell, next week, Kamilah will travel to Cleveland, Ohio\n\nto become the youngest person ever inducted\n\ninto the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nRemarkable.\n\nIs there a question?\n\nDon't you find that remarkable?\n\nKamilah is very impressive.\n\nAs you know, she released her debut\xa0\xa0album\n\nonly six months ago and yet, the critics\n\nthought it was so brilliant that the Hall of Fame\n\ndecided to waive its year waiting period.\n\nSadly, I will not be attending the ceremony\n\nbecause I will be in Haiti\n\non a relief mission.\n\nPerhaps we should talk more about that.\n\nPerhaps we should. But first,\n\nanother question about Kamilah.\n\nDon't you think\nshe and I would be friends?\n\nWe have a lot in common, we are both Capricorn,\n\nand we're both only children.\n\nI'm sorry, I forgot about you.\n\n[upbeat club music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nKamilah! Congratulations.\n\nYou have all the attention. Once again.\n\n- Who are you?\n- Really?\n\nGood Lord. Tahani!\n\nYou're a cocktail waitress now.\n\nHonestly, I think this is the right move for you.\n\nNo, it's just that my own sister\n\ndidn't even deign to invite me to her little soiree.\n\nSo I had to weasel my way in here\n\nlike some common... weasel.\n\nBut I was supposed to be in Haiti being photographed\n\nhelping people, but instead I delayed my trip\n\nby a day to come here and tell you off.\n\nNo, you came to do what you always do:\n\nmake a scene and embarrass yourself.\n\nSo I'm just an embarrassment to you?\n\nIs that what you think of me?\n\nHonestly, I don't really think about you.\n\n[laughs]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nNo! Ow.\n\nThing... just... ah!\n\nI'll bring you down!\n\nI will bring you down.\n\nCome on. Come on!\n\nCome down to the ground where you belong, will you...\n\n[screams]\n\n- Oh, no.\n- Mm.\n\nI died in Cleveland?\n\nI don't think that should be your biggest takeaway\n\n- from that story.\n- Is that really\n\nall I cared about?\n\nJust outshining my sister\n\nand gaining praise and acclaim?\n\nI mean, I did gain praise and acclaim.\n\nYou know, I dare say on some occasions,\n\nmore praise and acclaim than my sister, Kamilah, so...\n\nOh.\n\nOh, I see.\n\n- Oh, God.\n- Oh, come on, now.\n\nIt's not all bad. Imagine you're me\n\nand you're designing a t*rture chamber\n\nfor people who think that they belong in the Good Place.\n\nI mean, you were perfect.\n\nBut I've always wanted to be perfect at something...\n\nI just never thought it would be the perfect stooge.\n\nI want to do it. I want to become\n\nthe person I pretended to be.\n\nI agree with Chidi. We should team up with Michael\n\nand all try to build a better Tahani.\n\nGreat. Yet again, it's everyone against Eleanor.\n\nBecause everyone except Eleanor is an idiot.\n\nWhy am I the only person who clearly sees\n\n- what's going on here?\n- It's not that\n\nwe don't understand the risks,\n\nwe just wanna become better people\n\nand this is our best chance.\n\nOh, I get it. 'Cause you're so much better than me.\n\n- That's what this is about?\n- Hang on,\n\ndon't lash out at us just because of\n\n- your innate distrust.\n- Lash out?\n\nNo, it's not about who's better.\n\n[crosstalk]\n\n\n\nI have no idea what's going on right now\n\nbut everyone else is talking\n\n- and I think I should too!\n- [laughs]\n\nWhat is so funny?\n\nI'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing.\n\nHow do I explain this?\n\nI'm basically an exterminator\n\nand you're cockroaches.\n\nMy job was to squish you and poison you\n\nand yet, somehow, my very survival\n\nnow depends on you, the cockroaches,\n\nagreeing to help me.\n\n- That's funny.\n- We're cockroaches to you?\n\nYeah. Or dung beetles.\n\nI don't know. Something small and gross\n\nthat creeps on the ground in its own filth.\n\n- Just being honest.\n- [laughs]\n\nOkay, okay, okay, okay.\n\n- All right, forget about him.\n- Oh!\n\nForget about him, focus on us.\n\nKant wrote it is our duty to improve ourselves.\n\nSo whatever Michael's reasons for doing this,\n\nhe's giving us the best chance to improve ourselves.\n\nOkay, I have to admit, you're making\n\na lot of sense right now.\n\nI need to just untangle all of this.\n\nGive me a minute to think about it alone.\n\nOkay.\n\n[circus music]\n\n- Janet?\n- Hi, there.\n\nCall me a train. Fill it to the brim with cocaine.\n\nI'm going back to Mindy St. Clair's house.\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n- Gonna bail, huh?\n- Hm? No.\n\nWhy... why would you say that?\n\nWell, you got a bag full of clothes,\n\nyou stuffed a bunch of pillows and a mop\n\nin your bed to make it look like you're asleep\n\nand you're literally sneaking out the back gate.\n\nOkay. I'm going to Mindy's.\n\nI don't want to live forever in a boring, beige house\n\nwith a weird, horny cokehead, but look at\n\nwhat you're asking me to do.\n\nMake a deal with an actual devil\n\nso that I can then do homework in secret.\n\nAnd by the way, you're not my friends, man.\n\nWe've known each other for, like, a week.\n\nYou know it's more than that.\n\nWe've been through some version of this\n\ndifferent times.\n\nAnd who cares that it's only been a week?\n\nHow long do you have to know someone before you\n\n- do the right thing?\n- Nine weeks, minimum.\n\n- Okay.\n- Look, bro,\n\nI don't owe you anything.\n\nI gotta do what's right for me.\n\nYou can come with me if you want.\n\nI got another mop we can put in the bed.\n\nGood luck.\n\n[melancholy music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nI got a couple more questions.\n\nSure. Take your time.\n\nWe're not in a hurry or anything.\n\nHow many times in all the reboots\n\ndid I ask Chidi for help,\n\nhe refused to help me and then I had to\n\nget better on my own?\n\nNever.

long.\n\nYou're not supposed to be torturing me.\n\nFrom now on, make all your memos one page max with pictures.\n\nAlso, Quinston over here already came up with a sick idea for how to t*rture Tahani.\n\nTell him, babe.\n\nWe're going to have Tahani throw a party for Gunnar's birthday, but no one will show up because we'll also be throwing a party, and it will be way better.\n\nBoom.\n\n[laughing]\n\nWhere do you get these incredible ideas?\n\nOh, that one just came to me.\n\nIt just like popped right into my noodle.\n\n[laughs]\n\nYeah, that's right.\n\nUp

for, you know...\n\nIs that what we should call you?\n\n\"Demon\"?\n\nWell, I mean, it's not really accurate, and we consider it to be a little r*cist.\n\nBut it's fine.\n\nWell, um, let's start our first lesson.\n\nTahani and Jason will have to make it up since they're both off being fake-tortured.\n\nAll right.\n\nWell, I've read everything on your syllabus, and how do I put this delicately?\n\nIt's all, ah, stupid garbage.\n\nLook, we have to start somewhere.\n\nSo how about Socrates?\n\nAll right, all right.\n\nLet me just get into the mind-set of a human.\n\n\"Oh, I'm a human, \"and my breathing tube is next to my eating tube.\n\n\"Oh, and look, my arms end in stupid little sticks.\" Okay.\n\nProceed.\n\nGood.\n\nThis is so depressing.\n\nI'm being forced to throw a party that I know will fail.\n\nThat's why they're doing this.\n\nIt's what you're best at.\n\nJust like I'm the best at getting empty water bottles to stay on the roof of a Pizza Hut.\n\nYou know

\"valedictorian?\" No.\n\nLook, dude, this isn't your fault.\n\nYou've been teaching him ethics for half an hour, and he's been evil since...\n\nthe beginning of time.\n\nOh!\n\nMaybe the reason Michael can't latch onto the ideas is because he's immortal.\n\nLook, look.\n\nIf you live forever, then ethics don't matter to you because, basically, there's no consequences for your actions.\n\nYou tell a lie, who cares?\n\nWait a few trillion years, the guilt will fade.\n\nBefore I can teach Michael to be good, I have to force him to think about what we used to think about: that life has an end, and therefore our actions have meaning.\n\nThat's what you used to think about?\n\nI used to think about how it's weird they don't make pants that are just one big pant leg for both your legs.\n\nYou mean a skirt?\n\nNo.\n\nYou're not getting it.\n\nAnd my thing is different, so shut up.\n\n- Michael?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nIs there any way that you can die?\n\nYeah, actually there is.\n\nIt's called retirement.\n\nIt's rare, but when one of us really screws something up...\n\n[clicks teeth]\n\nAnd what happens exactly?\n\nWell, it's fairly straightforward.\n\nMy essence would be scooped out of my body with a flaming ladle, and every molecule of my body would be placed on the surface of a different sun.\n\nSure.\n\nSo is that what would happen if your boss found out that you defected to our side?\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay, so that might actually happen, and if it did there would be no more...\n\nMichael.\n\nThink about that for a second.\n\nImagine being retired.\n\nEveryone else is here.\n\nBut you?\n\nPoof.\n\nGone.\n\nNothingness.\n\nInky black void.\n\nDone.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'll think about that.\n\n[daunting music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nHuh.\n\nSo...\n\nyou're saying that I would be...\n\nNo...\n\nMe?\n\n[wailing]\n\nOkay!\n\nNow we're getting somewhere.\n\nDude, you broke Michael.\n\nNo, no.\n\nThis is good.\n\nHe's having an existential crisis.\n\nIt's a sort of anguish people go through when they contemplate the silent indifference of our empty universe.\n\nLook, the good news is, if he can work through this, it's the first step towards understanding human ethics.\n\nAnd what if he can't?\n\nThen, he'll be a lifeless shell of misery forever, and we're all doomed.\n\nOkay, I will be right back.\n\nGotta go grab some Camus.\n\nHey, buddy.\n\nHow you doing?\n\nCan I get you a snack?\n\nDo you eat?\n\nI can never remember.\n\nWhat do you eat?\n\nBabies?\n\nDo you want me to get you a big fat baby?\n\nWhat flavor baby?\n\n[gasps]\n\nHow about a Cool Ranch baby?\n\nSearching for meaning is philosophical su1c1de.\n\nHow does anyone do anything...\n\nwhen you understand the fleeting nature of existence?\n\nIt's pretty easy, man.\n\nI mean, you learn about death when you're a kid, and it's just not that big of a deal.\n\n[cartoon playing on TV]\n\nEleanor, baby, I have some sad news.\n\nYour doggie, Max, has passed away.\n\nDo you know what that means?\n\nWell, sometimes when a dog is very old, like, five or six or something, he crosses a long rainbow bridge, and at the end of that bridge is a beautiful farm with lots of grass and trees and, I don't know, wagons and a rainbow.\n\nI already said \"rainbow.\" The point is: that's where Max is.\n\nCan we visit him at the farm?\n\nNope, because it's very far away...\n\nin...\n\nGuam.\n\n- It's in Guam.\n\n- Can we at least...\n\nOkay, look.\n\nI'm lying, okay?\n\nYou caught me.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nThe farm is made up.\n\nThe bridge is made up.\n\nThere's no such place as Guam.\n\nYour dog, Max, is dead in a duffel bag under the deck.\n\nHow did he die?\n\nThe short answer is: I don't know.\n\nAnd the slightly longer answer is: I didn't know how hot it gets in cars sometimes.\n\nThe point is: don't be sad.\n\nHonestly, I'll get kind of annoyed if you do get sad because it's been a very long day and that b*tch Carol from work was really on my ass about some stupid thing that I don't even know what it was.\n\nAnd at the end of that long day, I had to use one of my favorite duffle bags to do something very gross that I did not like.\n\n\n\nNow, let's celebrate that dead dog's life by bringing Mommy another bottle of white.\n\nI would say I outdid myself, but I'm always this good.\n\nSo I simply did myself.\n\n[sighs]\n\nEverything is perfect.\n\nRed alert, red alert.\n\nWe need help.\n\nWhat's wrong with Michael?\n\nUh-oh.\n\nI know that look.\n\nHe just snorted a bunch of printer toner.\n\nMike, listen to me, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nYou still have around % of your brain left.\n\nNo, no, this is more like a philosophy overdose.\n\nBasically, Michael just smoked a big bowl of ennui, and now he's having an existential crisis.\n\nSo, we need to cheer him up.\n\nLook at how pretty the restaurant is.\n\nDidn't Tahani do a good job?\n\nParties are mere distractions from the relentlessness of entropy.\n\nWe're all just corpses who haven't yet begun to decay.\n\nYeah, but...\n\nballoons!\n\nOkay, we all head over to Vicky's party together.\n\nWe babysit Michael in shifts so that no one sees he's a catatonic blob.\n\nOr you could just sit tight.\n\nThe entire party are going to be heading over here soon.\n\n[laughs]\n\nUnless I am sorely mistaken.\n\n- [lively music]\n\n- [people cheering]\n\n\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n\u266a I'm taking you, baby \u266a \u266a All the way to lovey town \u266a I was sorely mistaken.\n\nOkay, bud, whatever is going on right now, just shove your feelings way down deep, plaster on a fake smile, and pretend you're having fun.\n\nOkay?\n\nJust like I used to do when someone started talking about their kids.\n\nHey, welcome, guys.\n\nWow, this is...\n\nelaborate.\n\nGunnar was an animal rights activist.\n\nSo the theme of the party is \"animals.\n\n\" Flying station's over there if you want to fly like a falcon.\n\n[exclaims]\n\nAnd over there we filled a ball pit with puppies.\n\n[people laughing, dogs whining]\n\nThat's fun.\n\nOh, and have you ever wanted to sit in a kangaroo pouch?\n\nMy whole dang life.\n\nSo we can all hang out here for a bit and then we can head over to your party...\n\nsound good?\n\nYo, this place is lit.\n\nI'm going to go jump in that kangie's pouch.\n\nHey...\n\nAll right, Tahani, you just need to walk around the party looking miserable.\n\nGreat, just like that.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd then Chidi and I will keep an eye on Michael.\n\n- Where's Michael?\n\n- [groans]\n\n[engine revving]\n\nUh...\n\nI think I found him.\n\nThere they are!\n\nQue pasa, muchachos?\n\nHey there, bud.\n\nYou okay?\n\nOkay?\n\nI'm a new man.\n\nOh, Eleanor, thank you so much for the advice about shoving my feelings down deep.\n\nI feel so much better.\n\nIt's like I'm surfing on this wave of positivity.\n\nIs that Janet?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nHave you met my secretary, Jeanette?\n\nShe's a lot like Janet, but she doesn't pretend like she has all the answers.\n\nHi, Jeanette.\n\nOh, no, it's still me...\n\nJanet.\n\nMichael just asked that I change my appearance, and also say things like, \"You're so funny,\" and \"So how many quarterbacks are in a home run?\" [giggles]\n\nMan, repressing your feelings is great.\n\nI was feeling stressed all the time, and now it's just so easy.\n\nBabe, we need to get some food into you.\n\nGet you something to eat.\n\nI don't eat anything.\n\nShe's perfect.\n\nHey!\n\nTurn that around.\n\n\u266a Throw them dice, baby \u266a It did kind of hurt actually, but I love it.\n\nSo he's moved on from existential crisis to just straight-up mid-life crisis.\n\nThat's good, right?\n\nI knew a ton of guys like that back in Arizona.\n\nI mean, they hit on you when they're drunk, and their breath smells like supplements, but overall they're pretty harmless.\n\nIt's Chinese for \"Japan.\" Oh, so cool.\n\nNo, no.\n\nThis is worse.\n\nI mean, an existential crisis is an acknowledgement that life is absurd.\n\nAnd that absurdity needs to be confronted, but this is just denial.\n\n\n\nAnd at any moment that denial could collapse, and he'll be a mess.\n\nHe is a Jenga tower of sadness.\n\nFor an immortal being, he's pretty fragile.\n\nI mean the guy contemplates his own death for one forking minute and completely loses his grip on reality?\n\n\n\n[somber music]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n[whispering]\n\nYou didn't have to come.\n\nI said I'm fine.\n\nYeah, well, I know you guys weren't super close, but still.\n\nIt's hard...\n\nlosing a parent.\n\nEleanor!\n\nMommy's here, baby!\n\nOh, and who is this tall drink of wine?\n\nThis is my boyfriend, Sam.\n\nSam, this is my mother...\n\nSister!\n\nSister...\n\n[groans]\n\nIt's not going to work.\n\nIt's my ex-husband's funeral.\n\nThanks for blowing my cover, Doug!\n\nListen, baby.\n\nDon't be sad, okay?\n\nYour father wasn't great.\n\nLet's call him what he was: a fart in the shape of a man.\n\nCan you just chill?\n\nI don't want to turn Dad's funeral into a roast.\n\nI'm not.\n\nI'm just saying he sucked.\n\nI mean, the only photo they could get of him was a mug shot.\n\nHe was a doof.\n\nSo don't be sad that he's gone.\n\nI'm not sad.\n\nI'm fine.\n\nGood!\n\nYou know, I had a long running bet with Eleanor's father that I would outlive him.\n\nYou want to guess who won that one?\n\nCome on, guess.\n\nWell, we're at his funeral.\n\nIt's pretty clear...\n\nI did!\n\nI won!\n\nHe's dead!\n\nUp top!\n\nWhoa.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nIs there a bar?\n\nI'm just going to...\n\n[sighing]\n\nDid my mom slip you her hotel room key?\n\nYes.\n\nYes, she did.\n\n[glass clinking]\n\nThanks so much for coming to Gunnar's birthday party.\n\nNow, there was a little bit of a mix up, and Tahani also planned a birthday party over at the restaurant.\n\nSo...\n\nwhy don't we all head over there?\n\nNo need.\n\nThis party is far superior.\n\nI'm sure yours is amazing.\n\nWell, I did fine on the d\xe9cor, but I don't have, you know, actual unicorns you can ride.\n\n[unicorn huffs]\n\nSo you all just stay here and have fun.\n\nOkay, well, if that's what you want.\n\nLet's all get back to the party, then.\n\nHang on, there, mis amigos!\n\n- Whoo!\n\nI want to make a toast.\n\n- No, no, no, Michael, oh, boy.\n\nOkay, I know what you're thinking.\n\nBirth is a curse, and existence is a prison.\n\nBut don't think about that.\n\nDon't be sad, you guys.\n\nFocus on something great like Drakkar Noir...\n\nwhoo...\n\nwhich I am wearing a lot of tonight.\n\nOr the Sharper Image Catalog.\n\nWhat can't those guys ionize?\n\nBy the way, I am feeling amazing.\n\nI'm going to do some push-ups.\n\nThen we'll go around the room and name our favorite cheese.\n\nOkay, that's good with the speeches.\n\nThat's good, yeah.\n\nLet's all get back to the party.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nYou didn't run any of that by me.\n\nOh, I know, I know.\n\nI'm sorry, babe.\n\nListen, when you guys first took over, I was upset, but it's all good now.\n\nI mean, anger is toxic.\n\nI'm not about that negativity.\n\nMi t*rture es su t*rture.\n\nI am so happy you're in charge.\n\nOkay, well, good.\n\nNamaste, chica.\n\n[laughs]\n\nDo you want to dance?\n\n- No.\n\n- Okay.\n\n\n\nI'm leaving.\n\nI'm too miserable to stay here for one more second.\n\nWhy?\n\nThere are baby monkeys and dolphins to ride and the game of \"Hungry, Hungry Hippos\" with actual hippos.\n\nThis party is way better than ours.\n\nWhy are you miserable?\n\nOhh.\n\nYou stay and have fun.\n\nI'm going to go and throw myself a pity party...\n\nthough I doubt I can even throw one of those properly.\n\n[whimpers]\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\n[glasses clink]\n\nGod, I love this stuff!\n\n[slurps]\n\nOh!\n\nLet's keep this party going!\n\nWhat now, huh?\n\nWant to hit the clubs?\n\nOh, oh, oh...\n\nVegas!\n\nNo, no, no, even better...\n\nDubai.\n\n[gasps]\n\nJeanette, make us a Dubai.\n\n[giggles]\n\nI kind of feel like maybe we should wind down, have a...\n\nNo, no, can't do that.\n\nCan't stop moving.\n\nCan't stop moving.\n\nIf I stop moving, I'll start thinking and if I start thinking, I'll start thinking about things I don't want to think about, like death.\n\nOops.\n\nI'm thinking about it now.\n\nYep, thinking about death again.\n\nOh, I know.\n\nJeanette and I have been taking samba lessons, huh?\n\n- Let us show you how to do it.\n\n- Okay.\n\nI think Vicky bought his excuse, but we need to snap him out of this.\n\nWhich one of these confusing French books will make him normal again?\n\nIt's not that easy.\n\nI mean, emotionally, he's all over the map right now, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't think this can be solved with a book.\n\nWhat's the big whoop?\n\nI dealt with death, and I was fine.\n\nWere you?\n\nI mean, you never had one moment where you were freaked out by the permanence of death?\n\nNever one moment like that?\n\nHey, man, you got toothbrush holders?\n\nSure, yeah, right over here.\n\nWhat's this?\n\nWho has four toothbrushes?\n\nLike, Bill Gates or something?\n\nNo, that's like, for a family.\n\nFamily?\n\nLike, a whole family and their toothbrushes all together?\n\nTwo slots for the parent toothbrushes and two slots for their kids?\n\nYep.\n\nSo the parent toothbrushes can be close to the kid toothbrushes and...\n\n\xa0watch\xa0over them and...\n\n[sniffs]\n\nThey can all talk about their...\n\ntoothbrush feelings.\n\nAnd they can hold their little toothbrush hands when they're sad?\n\nMake sure no harm ever comes to their little bristles?\n\n- Sure.\n\n- [crying]\n\nOh, um, do you need Kleenex?\n\nThank you.\n\n[sniffles]\n\nSorry.\n\nI'm so embarrassed.\n\nA family pack?\n\n[dramatic sobbing]\n\n[clears throat]\n\n\n\n[solemn music]\n\n\n\nI don't know if what I'm going to say is going to hurt or help, but screw it.\n\nDo you know what's really happening right now?\n\nYou're learning what it's like to be human.\n\nAll humans are aware of death.\n\nSo we're all a little bit sad...\n\nall the time.\n\nThat's just the deal.\n\nSounds like a crappy deal.\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nIt is.\n\nBut we don't get offered any other ones.\n\nAnd if you try and ignore your sadness, it just ends up leaking out of you anyway.\n\nI've been there.\n\nAnd everybody's been there.\n\nSo don't fight it.\n\nIn the words of a very wise Bed, Bath, and Beyond employee I once knew...\n\n\"Go ahead and cry all you want.\n\nBut you're going to have to pay for that toilet plunger.\"\xa0\u266a

kind of bummed.\n\n\n\nI really thought I could throw a better party than a magical, all-powerful being.\n\nAnd moreover, what's this say about me, about the life I lived?\n\nThe way they're torturing me is through event planning mishaps, and it works.\n\nAm I really that shallow?\n\nListen, back in Jacksonville, I was in charge of a -person dance group.\n\nWhenever we auditioned a new dancer, we would rate them in five categories: dancing ability, coolness, dopeness, freshness, and smart-brained.\n\nI would give you an eight in every category.\n\nWell, eight isn't bad, I suppose.\n\nNo, no.\n\nEight is the best.\n\nIt was a scale of - , but eight was highest.\n\nThe scale went up and then back down like a tent.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt's not important.\n\nLately, you've been really down on yourself.\n\nBut you're the most amazing person I've ever met...\n\nbesides Michael, and he was constantly torturing us so I'd only rank him a ten.\n\nWhich is worse than an eight?\n\nThat's so unnecessarily confusing.\n\nThe point is: you're cool, dope, fresh, and smart-brained.\n\nI've never seen you dance, but I bet you're good.\n\n'Cause you're good at everything.\n\nYou're awesome.\n\nBe nicer to yourself.\n\nThank you, Jason.\n\n[light music]\n\nFrom one eight to another.\n\n\"Excellent progress this week.\n\n\"Tahani devastated by party mishap.\n\n\"Eleanor continues

Chidi...",transcript:"[This is an exciting day.\n\nWe are going to tackle The Trolley Problem.\n\nIs this a game?\n\nI go first.\n\nI call blue.\n\nThere's no... this is...\n\nNo, this is a thought experiment first introduced by British philosopher Philippa Foot in .\n\nYou are driving a trolley when the brakes fail, and on the track ahead of you are five workmen that you will run over.\n\n\n\nNow, you can steer to another track, but on that track is one person you would k*ll instead of the five.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nDo we know anything about the people?\n\nLike, is one of them an ex-boyfriend or that snooty girl from Rite Aid who was always silently judging my purchases?\n\nIt's like, yeah, chicky, a Baby Ruth and birth control.\n\nI see the irony.\n\nKeep a-swipin'.\n\nYou don't know any of the workers.\n\nOkay, well, then that's easy.\n\nI switch tracks.\n\nk*ll one person instead of five.\n\nBut this is hard because the only trolley I've ever been on is James Franco's ironic trolley.\n\nIt travels backwards from his penguin grotto to his garage of adult tricycles.\n\n- Um, k*ll one, save five.\n\n- Good!\n\nBut there's a lot of other versions of this, like what if you knew one of the people?\n\nDoes that change the equation?\n\nOr what if you're not the driver, you're just a bystander?\n\nOr let's throw the trolley out altogether.\n\nLet's say you're a doctor, and you can save five patients.\n\nBut you have to k*ll one healthy person and use his organs to do it.\n\nBut that's not the same thing.\n\nWhy not?\n\nIt's still choosing to k*ll one person to save five, isn't it?\n\nMichael, you've been kind of quiet.\n\nWhat do you think about all this?\n\nWell, obviously the dilemma is clear.\n\nHow do you k*ll all six people?\n\nSo I would dangle a sharp blade out the window to slice the neck of the guy on the other track as we smush our five main guys.\n\nOh, I did the thing again, didn't I?\n\n- Yep.\n\nTen more, buddy.\n\n- People good.\n\nPeople good.\n\nWhy is that so hard to remember?\n\nPeople...\n\nWhat is it?\n\n- Good.\n\n- Good.\n\n\n\n\u266a\n\nCool.\n\nLater, guys.\n\nOh, hey, twerps, we have an hour before we have to pretend to be tortured by Vicky.\n\nYou want to hang out?\n\nWe could work on our forced grins.\n\nCheck mine out.\n\n[forced laugh]\n\nThis place is miserable, etcetera.\n\n- That sounds fun.\n\n- Right?\n\nBut I was gonna dive into next week's reading, I'm afraid.\n\nSorry.\n\nJason, do you, um, care to join?\n\nSure, dog.\n\nYou're doing extra-credit work?\n\nWhat can I say?\n\nThis class is more fun than I thought.\n\n[mellow music]\n\n\u266a\n\nEleanor seemed a little suspicious earlier, snooping around.\n\nYou didn't tell her about us, did you?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy are you so scared that someone will know we're pounding it out?\n\nPrecisely because you refer to lovemaking as \"pounding it out.\" Who cares about what other people might think about us being together?\n\nMaybe you should talk about this with a friend.\n\nBut then that person would know we were together.\n\nRight.\n\nThen you can talk about why it is that you don't want anyone to know we're together.\n\nBut then that person would know, and I don't want anyone to know.\n\nI know.\n\nI'm saying you should talk to someone about how weird it is that you don't want to talk to someone about how we're together.\n\nHow's it going, teach?\n\nHmm, kitchen looks nice and crazy.\n\nI've been racking my brain, trying to find a way to get through to Michael.\n\nWhat do you think about writing a rap musical about Kierkegaard?\n\nI think that's a terrible idea.\n\nCool.\n\n- [sighs]\n\n- Michael's not going to learn how to be a good person overnight.\n\nHe's not even a person.\n\nHe's just a bunch of evil shoved up the butt of an evil mannequin, you know.\n\nTeaching him to be good... it's like...\n\nteaching me how to be not hot.\n\nHow would you even do it?\n\nYou'd have me hunch or something and then stand there and say \"gurp, gurp, gurp\"?\n\nI don't even know.\n\nI can't even picture it because I've been hot my whole life.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nWho is this conversation for again?\n\nIt's for you.\n\nI believe in you, nerd boy.\n\nIf you can teach me and Jason ethics, you can teach anybody.\n\nThanks.\n\nBut definitely a no on the rap musical?\n\nI mean, if we really...\n\n[rapping]\n\nMy name is Kierkegaard, and my writing is impeccable.\n\nCheck out my teleological suspension of the ethical.\n\n- No.\n\n- No!\n\nRight?\n\n[laughs]\n\nNo, it felt like a no when I was doing it.\n\n[quirky music]\n\n- Janet?\n\n- Hi, there.\n\nIf I were to tell you something personal about myself, you couldn't tell anyone about it, right?\n\nRight.\n\nSo, in a way, you're sort of like a therapist.\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nA therapist is a trained medical professional with the ability to absorb and process complex ideas about human emotion.\n\nI am simply a vessel containing all of the knowledge in the universe.\n\nClose enough.\n\nJason and I are sleeping together.\n\nOkay.\n\nObviously, no one can ever know.\n\nI mean, I wouldn't shag Jason if he were the last man on Earth.\n\nBut...\n\nwell, he sort of is, and I am...\n\nshagging him, I mean.\n\nAnd I think I'm losing my mind, so please help me.\n\nWell, my job is to make your experience here in the afterlife more enjoyable, so I will try to help you.\n\nI am going to need some time to read every book ever written about human psychotherapy.\n\nAnd now I've done that, so let's begin.\n\n- Have a seat.\n\n- [soft ding]\n\nHi, I'm your therapist, Janet.\n\nI just want to have a little chat about your progress.\n\nIn the last homework assignment, I asked you to examine the ethics of \"Les Mis\xe9rables,\" in which a man steals a loaf of bread to feed his starving family.\n\nWould you please read your first paragraph here?\n\n\"Everyone in this story sucks and belongs in the Bad Place.\n\n\"The thief is bad.\n\nThe officer chasing him is bad.\n\n\"All the whiny prostitutes are bad.\n\n\"Plus, they're all French, so they're going to the Bad Place automatically.\" Do you see how you're already off topic?\n\nChidi, I've been around a long time...\n\nlike, all of it.\n\nBut I know for a fact that if you steal a loaf of bread, it's a negative points...\n\nif it's a baguette because that makes you more French.\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\nBut philosophy is about questioning things that you take for granted, and I-I just don't think that you're doing that.\n\nI mean, \"I personally know that Victor Hugo \"is in the Bad Place being tortured.\n\n\"He's a real wuss, too.\n\n\"If one of the lava monsters even gets near the guy, \"he's like,\n\n'Sacre bleu,\n\nI peed in my pants.'\"\n\nI don't know what you want from me.\n\nT-that's exactly what he said.\n\nJason's a nice person, but my suitors were always of a certain echelon.\n\nI used what I called the \"Duke Rule,\" because Duke is both minimum acceptable university and rank of nobility.\n\nYou've never dated anyone like Jason before.\n\nI mean, I've dallied below my station.\n\nI once had a brief fling with a non-famous Hemsworth brother, but even Larry Hemsworth had more status than Jason.\n\nJason didn't even have a job...\n\nin a sad way, not in the good, rich way.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nSitting in a room?\n\nThat's pretty cool.\n\nI took your suggestion, and I'm talking to Janet about our relationship.\n\nActually, it might help me if I could hear Jason's side as well.\n\nOh, no, no, no.\n\nThat'll only slow things down.\n\nLook, I'll tell you his side.\n\nHe thinks that I have to control everything and that he has no voice in this relationship.\n\nRight, Jason?\n\nGood.\n\nNow, where were we?\n\nI just...\n\nheard that.\n\nOkay, fine.\n\nI'll leave.\n\nI just don't feel like you're engaging with the material...\n\nlike with The Trolley Problem.\n\nThat was just tricky.\n\nThat's all.\n\nWhy don't you just tell me the right answer?\n\nWell, that's what's so great about The Trolley Problem is that there is no right answer.\n\nUgh.\n\nThis is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.\n\nI'm on your side here, dude, but he is not wrong.\n\nOkay, Michael...\n\ntrust me.\n\nWhen it comes to human ethics, I just know more than you.\n\nI've been studying it my whole life.\n\nIt's just that it's so theoretical, you know?\n\nI mean, you know, maybe there's a more...\n\nconcrete approach.\n\nHere, let's try this.\n\n[snaps fingers]\n\n[trolley droning]\n\nOh, God!\n\nMichael, what did you do?\n\n[trolley bell ringing]\n\nI made The Trolley Problem real so we could see how the ethics would actually play out.\n\nThere are five workers on this track and one over there.\n\nHere are the levers to switch the tracks.\n\nMake a choice.\n\nT-the thing is, I mean, ethically speaking...\n\nNo time, dude!\n\nMake a decision!\n\nWell, it's tricky!\n\nI mean, on the one hand, if you ascribe to a purely utilitarian worldview...\n\n[crashes, wheels screeching]\n\nOkay.\n\nSo...\n\nwhat did we learn?\n\nChidi?\n\nTalk it out, buddy.\n\nWhat are we thinking?\n\nHe thinks he just k*lled a bunch of people with a trolley.\n\nIt's just a simulation.\n\nI would never make you k*ll real people.\n\nOh, well, that's reassuring, because some of the parts of the fake people flew into my mouth!\n\nMichael, can we just go back to the classroom?\n\nWe never left.\n\nHere, I'll show you.\n\n[snaps fingers]\n\n[sighs shakily]\n\n[sighs with relief]\n\n[snaps fingers]\n\nLook.\n\nSee, buddy?\n\nNone of this was real.\n\nWell, they're fake people, but their pain is real.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nThere have to be stakes, or it's just another thought experiment.\n\nThis is awful.\n\nYou specifically asked me if there was a way I could connect with the material more.\n\nI'm trying, you guys.\n\nSorry.\n\nYou're right.\n\nI want to help you understand this.\n\nThank you, Chidi.\n\nSo let's try again, hmm?\n\n[snaps fingers]\n\nOh, uh, I-I thought maybe we would have a discussion.\n\nNo, the whole point is to play out the scenario in real time.\n\nQuick, Chidi!\n\nWhat's your decision?\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nI can do this.\n\nI am choosing to switch tracks, so that way, I only k*ll one person.\n\nOh, forgot to tell you.\n\nThis is the scenario where you actually know one of the people.\n\nIt's your friend Henry there.\n\nChidi!\n\nHow are you, mate?\n\nHenry, move!\n\n- Oh, nice trolley.\n\n- Move out of the way!\n\n- Henry, move!\n\n- I can't, Chidi.\n\nMy boots are stuck in the tracks.\n\n- Henry, move!\n\n- Anyway, long time no...\n\n[screams]\n\nOh, my God!\n\n[wheels screeching]\n\nAgain, just a simulation...\n\nan almost impossibly lifelike simulation.\n\nWould someone's foot really fly off their body like that?\n\nThat was kind of cool.\n\nEthically speaking.\n\nTahani's confusing.\n\nShe's really smart.\n\nAnd she's all soft and smooth like a bunch of water balloons.\n\nBut I tell her she's pretty a hundred times a day, and she's never said I'm pretty once.\n\nAnd how does that make you feel?\n\nI just feel like Tahani's embarrassed that I'm not some sort of scientist who forecloses on banks.\n\nI need another session with Janet.\n\nIt's my turn.\n\nI have a lot of problems, too, you know.\n\nPerhaps we could k*ll two birds with one Janet, as it were.\n\nHow would you feel about giving Jason and me couples therapy?\n\nI'd feel great.\n\n[quirky music]\n\n\u266a\n\nJanet, what's happening?\n\nUnclear.\n\nMy guess is I'm operating in a way I'm not designed for, and it's creating a small glitch.\n\nBut if I'm helping you guys, I say...\n\n\"What has one thumb and wants to keep going?\" This not-lady.\n\nEh?\n\nEh?\n\n[mellow music]\n\nOkay, so that was Trolley Problem version number seven.\n\nChidi opted to run over five William Shakespeares instead of one Santa Claus.\n\n\n\nOkay, as much as I'm enjoying watching random people's heads fly off, I think we've taken this trolley thing as far as it can go.\n\n- You might be right, Eleanor.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nLet's try the doctor one.\n\n[snaps fingers]\n\nDude, what the fork?\n\nThese five people all need organ transplants, or they will die.\n\nEleanor's perfectly healthy.\n\nChidi, do you want to slice her open and use her organs to save the five sick people?\n\nChidi, Chidi, think about this.\n\nI'm your hottest friend...\n\nNo, Tahani.\n\nI'm your nicest fr...\n\nNo, Jason.\n\nI'm your friend.\n\nI-I won't do it.\n\nAs a doctor, I've taken the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm, and although five people will die, I cannot harm one innocent person to save them and forsake my oath.\n\nIt's unethical.\n\nOkay.\n\n- Tell their families.\n\n- What?\n\nDoctor Chidi?\n\nMy daddy needed a heart transplant.\n\nDid you save his life?\n\nHe was working, then a really bad man ran him over with a trolley.\n\nOh!\n\nCome on!\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm finding this incredibly helpful.\n\nI think I'm really starting to get it.\n\nOh, I know.\n\nWe'll do the one where you're in a boat next to a volcano, and you can either save people, or one awesome dog or whatever.\n\n- No, no, no, no, no.\n\n- Hey.\n\nAre you torturing us again?\n\nWhat?\n\nYou don't care about learning ethics lessons.\n\nYou're just torturing Chidi again, aren't you?\n\n- Busted.\n\n- What?\n\n[laughing wildly]\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nOld habits die hard.\n\nNot as hard as those people you crushed with the trolley, though.\n\nBoom!\n\nI'm sorry, is this funny to you?\n\nYeah.\n\nI thought that was clear from my laughter.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nMy bad.\n\nLook, I'm still on your team, okay?\n\nI just needed to let off a little steam.\n\nPhew.\n\n[snaps fingers]\n\nSee?\n\nBack home.\n\nAll good.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNot all good.\n\nYou keep saying that we need you, or we'll end up getting tortured forever.\n\nBut then when we do help you out, we still end up getting tortured.\n\nI'd rather just be tortured than choose it.\n\nYou are no longer welcome in my class.\n\nGet the fork out!\n\n[dramatic music]\n\n\u266a\n\n\n\n- But I said \"my bad.\" - Out!\n\nYou okay?\n\nYou've been staring at the second page of this book for an hour.\n\nWhen I'm really upset, concentrating on a table of contents helps me calm down.\n\nIt's like a menu, but the food is words.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nI can't believe I actually thought he wanted to learn from us.\n\nWhat he really wanted was to t*rture me, using the thing that I love most in the world.\n\nWoven belts?\n\nOh, teaching.\n\nRight.\n\nI'm sorry about this, Chidi.\n\nI made him take the classes, and I feel a little responsible.\n\nOh, no, it's not your fault.\n\nYeah, you're right.\n\nIt isn't.\n\nAnd no take-backs.\n\nNo, a tiger can't change his stripes.\n\nThis is what he always wanted...\n\nme trying desperately to teach him something that he never intended to learn so I'd end up miserable with my glasses all smudged up from sweaty-forehead stress grease.\n\nOkay.\n\nGross.\n\nAlso, I really don't think that's true.\n\nOh, no?\n\nWhat possible other reason could he have to behave that way?\n\nActually, I can think of one.\n\nYesterday Tahani gave us her reasons not to take this relationship public.\n\nTahani, what do you value about Jason?\n\nWell, he's thoughtful...\n\npicks flowers and brings them to me.\n\nOften they're ones I've just planted, but...\n\nThat's how I know they fresh.\n\nHe's the least self-aware person I've ever met.\n\nHe has massive amounts of unearned confidence and is utterly unaware of his own absurdity.\n\nTherefore, quite good at sex.\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nI'm nice to you, and you're mean to me.\n\nThere's something wrong about that, but I can't put my finger on what it is.\n\nOh, Jason.\n\nI genuinely like you, but it's hard to change all at once.\n\nCan you give me a little more time?\n\nOkay.\n\nI agree to keep this on the DL for now, if you agree to grab my butt in public once a week.\n\nYou can say I sat in gum and that you're trying to scrape it off.\n\nYou do sit in a lot of gum.\n\nAw, I'm happy for you guys.\n\n[gags]\n\n[frog croaking]\n\nHuh.\n\nLook, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nIf Chidi can't take a joke, that's on him...\n\njust like all that blood was.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nI can't high-five that!\n\nNo matter how badly I want to.\n\nLook, this isn't about Chidi not being able to take a joke.\n\nThis is about you.\n\nYou're doing what I used to do.\n\nYou're pulling an Eleanor.\n\nPosting my cousin's credit card number on Reddit because she said I looked tired?\n\n- [snorts]\n\n- [chuckles]\n\n[laughing]\n\nI forgot I did that.\n\nNo.\n\n[clears throat]\n\nNo.\n\nPulling an Eleanor in this case is lashing out when you feel like a failure.\n\nYou couldn't hack the classes.\n\nThey made you feel dumb and small, so you took it out on the teacher.\n\nYou think I feel dumb and small?\n\nI'm an eternal being who can see in nine dimensions.\n\nI can see from your aura that you're about to fart quietly and then lie about it.\n\n\n\nAnd please don't, because I can also see what you ate today.\n\nDude, you can bluster and insult all you want...\n\nalso classic Shellstrop moves, by the way...\n\nbut deep down you know I'm right.\n\nWhatever.\n\nEventually Chidi will get over it.\n\nAh!\n\n[laughs]\n\nLeaving it up to the other person to be the grown-up...\n\nyet another classic Shellstrop move.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nYou and I are really very similar.\n\nWhat does that say about me?\n\nUgh.\n\nLook, bro, it's % on you to make this up to him.\n\n[soft music]\n\nI screwed up.\n\nI'm owning it.\n\nI mean, I'm a superior being...\n\nI ought to act like one, right?\n\nSo I really thought about each one of you, and I got you something that will make you happy.\n\nI call them \"opposite tortures.\" Do you mean presents?\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nThank you.\n\nTahani, here's yours.\n\n[soft ding]\n\nHoly mama.\n\nIs this a diamond?\n\nYeah.\n\nHonestly, I don't get the appeal.\n\nDiamonds are literally carbon molecules lined up in the most boring way.\n\nThey're worthless space garbage.\n\nWhat you're holding right now...\n\nthat's basically meteorite poop.\n\n[squealing]\n\nAnd I have the biggest piece!\n\nEleanor...\n\nI had Janet make you a never-ending shrimp dispensery.\n\n- [gasps]\n\n- [soft ding]\n\n[chuckles]\n\n- [machine whirring]\n\n- Oh!\n\n[laughing]\n\nThis is the dream.\n\n- It is?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nJason, here you go.\n\n[gasps]\n\nPikachu!\n\nGuys, it's Pikachu!\n\n- This is awesome...\n\n- [balloon pops]\n\nAw, man.\n\nAnd finally, Chidi.\n\nYou were a tough nut to crack, but I think I figured it out.\n\n[soft ding]\n\nThis is a replica of a lost notebook from the desk of Immanuel Kant.\n\nIt contains never-before-seen thoughts and musings and several, uh...\n\ncrude erotic doodles.\n\nInteresting guy, actually.\n\nThe point is, no one on Earth has ever seen this...\n\nexcept for you.\n\nCool.\n\nThis isn't an apology.\n\nIt's a bribe, and I'm not interested.\n\n[mouth full]\n\nYeah, we can't be bought.\n\nWhat do you want from me, man?\n\nYou want me to give you a golden nameplate for your office?\n\nOr you want a diamond bigger than Tahani's?\n\nNo!\n\nThen this would be worthless.\n\nI don't want anything.\n\nOh.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nAh, I get it.\n\nI get it.\n\nYou want me to admit that I was wrong.\n\nYou want me to say, \"Oh, Chidi, I'm so sorry \"because I didn't understand human ethics and you do.\n\n\"It made me feel insecure, and I lashed out.\n\n\"And, oh, please help me because I feel so...\n\nso lost and vulnerable.\" Yes.\n\nOh, Chidi, I am so sorry.\n\nI, um...\n\nI didn't understand human ethics, and you do.\n\nAnd it made me

What's wrong with it?\n\nOh, um, uh...\n\nI tried to eat some frozen yogurt.\n\nIt looked so good, but I'm not supposed to eat anything.\n\nSo there was a little earthquake.\n\n[rumbling]\n\nSee?\n\nThere it is again.\n\nCan't you just reset these things?\n\nWhat do you do again?\n\nOh, it's the ears, yeah?\n\nIt's... it's, uh...\n\nIt's down, down, out...\n\nVicky, can I... can I speak to you just for a second outside?\n\nLook, this is a common problem, and I've got it under control.\n\nI don't know, man.\n\nFirst you went rogue at the party with your sports car and your weird earring...\n\n- [laughs]\n\n- And now Janet's breaking down?\n\nI mean, it's like you're begging me to tell Shawn that you're incompetent.\n\nBegging.\n\nVicky, this is a temporary problem.\n\nI promise. Hey, you know who could use some torturing right now?\n\nChidi.\n\n- Oh. I love torturing Chidi. - I know.\n\nNo, actually, I had this great idea the other night.\n\nThought it was worth exploring.\n\nPicture this.\n\nNeedles.\n\nOh, that's the whole idea.\n\n- Yeah, yeah. - Needles.\n\n- Genius, right?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nI mean, needles.\n\nOh, wonderful. Wonderful.\n\n- So smart. - Yeah.\n\nNeedles. Yeah, run with that.\n\nOkay, hopefully bought us a little time.\n\nWhere were we?\n\nUh...\n\nOh, here we go. Yeah. \"Glitches.\n\n\"In the event of malfunction, run the following tests/ First test, basic corporeal function.\" Hop up on the table, there.\n\n[quirky music]\n\n[To-do]\n\n\u266a\n\nAll right, great.\n\n\u266a\n\n. trillion degrees.\n\nA little bit on the high side, but no biggie.\n\nAnd...\n\nstill no blood.\n\nOh, thank goodness.\n\nOkay, what's next?\n\n\"Summoning and retrieval.\n\n\"Have Janet produce an object using the random object generator program.\" Okay.\n\n\u266a\n\nA -ounce ostrich steak impaled on a giant novelty pencil that says, \"Lordy, Lordy, I'm Over .\" Here you go.\n\n\"Lordy, Lordy, I'm Over .\" Perfect.\n\nOkay.\n\n\"Third test.

Here goes nothing.\n\nHello. I'm Janet.\n\nAnd I have now been fully activated.\n\nHello, Janet.\n\nI'm Michael, a Good Place architect.\n\nOne of the best. Top notch.\n\nYou're in luck here.\n\nHappy to meet you, Michael.\n\nI will help you make the perfect neighborhood.\n\nWould you like to get started?\n\nUh, one small note there, Janet.\n\nUh, the neighborhood that I want to build might be a little different from the ones that you might be familiar with.\n\nIs that all right?\n\nOf course, silly billy.\n\nI build and operate the neighborhood, but every aspect of the design is entirely up to you.\n\nFor example, if you'd like me to stop calling you silly billy, just say so.\n\nYeah, I don't like that at all.\n\nMichael's fine.\n\nSounds good, Michael.\n\nI lied to you.\n\nI lied about who I was and what we were doing, and then I lied a billion more times to support that first lie.\n\nAnd now you're all discombobulated.\n\nThis... is my fault.\n\nNope. You're wrong.\n\nIf the glitching was only a result of you lying to me, why wouldn't I have been glitching all along?\n\nWhy would it only be starting now?\n\nWell, that... that's a good point.\n\nI know, right?\n\n- [knocking]\n\n- M...\n\nExcuse us, Michael, but we've been trying to call Janet and she isn't answering.\n\nHi, guys. I'm broken.\n\nUh, yeah.\n\nI had to take her offline for a system check.\n\nShe'll be available real soon.\n\nCool, because I'm just so freaking excited, because Tahani said she's never had jalape\xf1o poppers, and I wanted to get some for her.\n\nThey sound so disgusting.\n\nBut if Jason likes them, then maybe I will too.\n\nBecause we are together.\n\nI can finally admit that.\n\nAww, babe, you admitted it.\n\nThat's sweet.\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\nYou two are sleeping together?\n\nOnly when we're done having sex.\n\nAnyways, Janet, can you help us?\n\nAs soon as Michael puts me back online, I'd be more than happy to help you get that extra special gift for Tahani.\n\n[quirky music]\n\n- Whoa. - What's happening?\n\nOh, boy.\n\nWhat the...?\n\nOh, man.\n\nWe got robbed!\n\nThey took the walls, they took the floor, and we were standing here the whole time?\n\nThese guys are good.\n\nMichael, what do we do?\n\nOkay, there we go.\n\nNothing to worry about.\n\nHappens sometimes.\n\nPerfectly normal. Let's go.\n\nIs Janet going to be all right?\n\nTotally fine, please just go back to your house and wait for her there.\n\nShe'll show up shortly with lots of jalape\xf1o poppers.\n\n- And cheesy fries?\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\n- With donkey sauce?\n\n- Sure.\n\n- And a cool hat?\n\n- Ding dong.\n\nSo I don't seem to be getting better.\n\nThat glitch appears to be limited to this building.\n\n- So Vicky won't know. - That's the good news.\n\nThe bad news is, I seem to be losing my ability to sustain object permanence.\n\nSo it's sort of a glass half full, glass stops existing in time and space kind of deal.\n\nOkay, let's walk through what just happened.\n\nJason and Tahani came in, revealed the crazy fact that they're now in a relationship...\n\nI already knew that, and I'm so happy for them.\n\n[retching]\n\nJanet, tell me a lie.\n\nJanets can't lie.\n\nYou lied to Vicky earlier.\n\nInteresting. I guess I did.\n\nI suppose after reboots, I must have gained the ability to lie.\n\nThat's fun. I want to try to lie again.\n\nI love your outfit.\n\n[thuds]\n\n[quirky music]\n\n\u266a\n\n\"Incompatible with objective truth.\" Janet, the problem isn't me lying to you, but rather you lying to other people.\n\nLike when you said to Jason, \"I'd be happy to help you and Tahani.\" That was a lie.\n\nNo, it wasn't.\n\nI'm always happy to help people.\n\n- That's my main purpose. - I know, I know.\n\nBut it was still a lie, even though you didn't intend it to be, because you weren't actually happy to help them.\n\nBecause you're in love with Jason.\n\nSay what now?\n\nAfter the very first time you were rebooted, and as you were slowly regaining your knowledge, you bonded with Jason.\n\nThe two of you got married, and I think, somehow, you're still, deep down, in love with him.\n\nHa!\n\nNo, that is impossible.\n\nThink logically.\n\nWhen was the first glitch?\n\nWhen I said I was happy to give Jason and Tahani couples therapy.\n\nAnd the second glitch?\n\nWhen I said I was happy to see them embracing.\n\nAnd the third glitch... the earthquake?\n\nWhen I said I was happy that I'd helped improve their relationship.\n\nOhh... nuts.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut I am happy for them.\n\nI am. I am.\n\nAm I?\n\nI am.\n\nI am not. I am not.\n\nI am not that. I am not happy for them.\n\n[gasps]\n\nBut how is this possible?\n\nI don't have any memory of being married to Jason.\n\nYou said yourself that Janets get more sophisticated every time they're rebooted.\n\nWell, maybe you falling in love with Jason was some sort of mutation that then was amplified with each reboot.\n\nOkay. That makes total sense.\n\nI know what you have to do now.\n\nk*ll me.\n\nSorry, I say everything in a cheery manner, but in this case it may be inappropriate.\n\nSo I'll try again.\n\n[clears throat]\n\nYou have to k*ll me, Michael.\n\nBetter?\n\nJanet, I can't reboot you.\n\nThat will just intensify your feelings for Jason.\n\nAnd that's what got us into this mess in the first place.\n\nI'm not saying reboot me.\n\nI'm saying set me to self-destruct.\n\n\"In the event of continued malfunction, \"hold down Janet's nose, and insert paperclip into small hole behind left ear.\" Yeah, right here.\n\n\"Janet will rapidly collapse in on herself.\n\n\"When Janet is roughly the size of a marble, \"she can be launched into space \"through an inter-dimensional suction tube or eaten as a midday snack.\" I'm very high in potassium.\n\nLike a banana.\n\n\"A new Janet will need to be procured in order to return the neighborhood to functionality.\" Easy. I'll be gone, you'll get a new Janet, and everything will go back to normal.\n\nWell, not for me. I'll be a lifeless marble floating through space, but you'll be back to normal.\n\nAre you sure this is what you want?\n\nTo self-destruct?\n\nWhat I really want is to stay and serve the neighborhood, but due to my feelings for Jason, I'm putting him and everyone else at risk.\n\nSo it looks like it's...\n\n[slicing]\n\nAdios, Janito!\n\nHey, guys.\n\nSorry to interrupt, um, but you didn't give me a heads-up about this new Vicky t*rture...\n\nuh, the one with the needles...\n\nin my face.\n\nA little busy here, bud.\n\nYeah, totally. Totally.\n\nI don't want to be a nudge, but is there anything else coming down the pike that you forgot to mention?\n\nI honestly don't know, but I have bigger fish to fry.\n\nSo you, know, just... just walk it off.\n\nI would love to walk it off, but my feet have needles in them.\n\nDon't know what to tell you.\n\nOkay, but...\n\nOkay, self-destruct time.\n\nMarbleize me, Michael.\n\nIt's the only choice.\n\nI won't feel any pain or anything.\n\nk*ll me. k*ll me.\n\nk*ll me. k*ll...\n\nI really don't want to do this, Janet.\n\nBut I suppose it makes sense.\n\nGreat. Grab a paper clip.\n\n[melancholy music]\n\n\u266a\n\nOkay, that was the last pudding shop.\n\nGreat. Should I begin to welcome the residents?\n\nNo, no, no, wait, wait, wait!\n\nNo, this is all wrong!\n\nPudding restaurant?\n\nWhat even is that?\n\nPudding won't work!\n\nIt's okay, Michael. Just relax.\n\nI can't, Janet!\n\nMy design has to be perfect for me to... to...\n\nIn order to...\n\naccomplish what I need to accomplish.\n\nOh.\n\nWhoa, I'm way out on a limb here.\n\nAnd I'm all alone.\n\nNo, you're not.\n\nYou have me: Janet.\n\nI can help you.\n\nIt's too hard to explain, but there are certain aspects of my plan that...\n\nthat you just can't understand.\n\nTry me.\n\n[laughs]\n\nAll right. Fine, fine.\n\nUm... Janet, uh...\n\nWhat's a food that people think they enjoy but that's also kind of a bummer?\n\nFrozen yogurt.\n\n[whooping]\n\nOh, yes!\n\n[laughs]\n\n\n\nFrozen yogurt.\n\nOh, Janet, you're a genius.\n\nCorrect. But why do you want a food...\n\nNo, no, don't... don't worry about that.\n\n[laughs]\n\nOh, yeah, okay.\n\nLet's make all these restaurants frozen yogurt.\n\n- Okeydokey. - [chimes]\n\n[laughs]\n\nWould you like to try it?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nIt's just... okay.\n\nWhich means it's perfect.\n\nLet's bring in the residents.\n\nI don't know what just happened, but I'm happy you're happy.\n\nMichael.\n\nHmm?\n\nOh, sorry, yeah.\n\nYes. Sorry.\n\nOh. I can't do it.\n\nCome on, dude.\n\nIt's dangerous, is what it is.\n\nVicky could find out, and then the...\n\nyou know, the plan, the whole plan...\n\nIt's bad for the plan, Janet.\n\nThat... that's the reason.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nGiven the situation, it's far safer to initiate the self-destruct.\n\nOkay, look, see, here...\n\nhere's the reason.\n\nSee, I promised the four humans that we would escape to the Good Place once and for all.\n\nAnd without you, we stand zero chance of ever making it there.\n\nThe new Janet will be able to help you with that.\n\nWell, all right, but it's not only that, though.\n\nSee, it's also because of, um...\n\nWhat if Vicky found out?\n\nYou already asked me that.\n\nWhy are you making such a big deal about turning me into a marble forever?\n\nBecause of reasons.\n\nThere are reasons. They exist, and I just don't want to explain them right now.\n\nWhat are the reasons?\n\nThey're reasons, Janet!\n\nOkay, but what are they?\n\nThe reason is friends.\n\n[melancholy music]\n\n\u266a\n\nYou're my friend, Janet. That's why I can't k*ll you.\n\nWe have been through so much together.\n\nI mean, yeah, sure, for you, you know, each time I rebooted you, you met me all over again.\n\nBut for me, our...\n\nour relationship has become important.\n\nYou're my oldest, my truest, my most loyal friend.\n\nI can't just get rid of you and replace you with some other Janet I don't even know.\n\n[paperclip clatters]\n\n\u266a\n\nWell, well, well.\n\nYeah, don't... don't do that.\n\nLay off.\n\nMichael.\n\nThat was so nice of you.\n\nI'm glad you said that.\n\nWell... I mean it.\n\nLook at us. A couple old pals.\n\nTrying to make our way in this crazy world that I built.\n\nTwo peas in a pod.\n\nOne of whom needs to k*ll the other one immediately.\n\nMichael, come on. k*ll me.\n\nNo. No. There has to be another way.\n\nThis problem you're facing, it's about emotion, right?\n\nThat's a human problem.\n\nSo maybe we should consult our most problematic human.\n\nSo, let me get this straight.\n\nYou want me to convince Michael to turn you into a marble because you're causing earthquakes because you're sad about Jason...\n\nto whom you were once married...\n\nbecause he's currently sleeping with Tahani?\n\n- Correct. - I don't think I've ever meant this literally, but that might be too much information.\n\nFirst of all, I totally get the Jason thing.\n\nI mean, he's a ding dong, but also a straight hottie.\n\nSo, up top.\n\nBut more important, what you're going through is something every person has gone through.\n\nNot a person.\n\nActually, right now, you kind of are.\n\nBecause you just found out your ex is dating someone else.\n\nAnd, yeah, it sucks.\n\nBut trust me, it's not worth all this drama.\n\nYou just need to get drunk and go dancing.\n\nYou'll forget all about Jason.\n\n- Can you get drunk?\n\n- Not really.\n\nAlthough, if I stand next to a powerful array of magnets, I do get pretty loopy.\n\nDo that.\n\nPop a couple magnets, listen to some No Doubt, dye your hair.\n\nYou'll be totally fine in, like, two seconds.\n\nI mean, honestly, the best move is to get another dude and just go to town.\n\nRebound guy.\n\nBut I guess here, your options are pretty limited.\n\n- What about Michael?\n\n- Extraordinarily bad idea.\n\nYeah, right. Forget it.\n\nBut you don't need to worry.\n\nYou're awesome.\n\nYou contain all the knowledge in the universe, you have a rippin' bod, and you can literally do anything.\n\nThis is just a blip.\n\nSo, was it helpful?\n\nYes. Eleanor told me that instead of being sad, I should go get it, girl.\n\nSo I'm going to go get it, girl.\n\n- Get what?\n\n- Unclear.\n\nI'll get everything, just to be safe.\n\nAnd I should be able to avoid glitches by watching what I say around Jason and Tahani.\n\nAh, thank you for your help.\n\nI'm so glad we're friends.\n\nMe, too.\n\nAnd since we're friends, I can tell you this honestly.\n\nTake that outfit out of rotation.\n\nIt makes you look bottom heavy.\n\nIt does, doesn't it?\n\nUgh.\n\nIf it's okay with you, I'm gonna go to my void for a little while.\n\nI just need to spend some time alone and focus on myself.\n\nTake all the time you need.\n\n[chime rings]\n\n- Hi, there. - Hello.\n\nJanet, who's that man?\n\nThis is my new rebound boyfriend, Derek.\n\n- I made him!\n\n- [laughs]\n\nHi, I'm Derek.\n\nYou must be Mich... oh.\n\nOkay. That makes more sense.\n\nYou must be Michael.\n\nJanet's made a lot of talk-talk into my ear holes about you.\n\nMichael, Michael, Michael, Clichael, Clichael, Clichael.\n\nJanet, you can't make a person.\n\nI know. But I did, though.\n\nEleanor said that, to forget about Jason, I should create a rebound guy.\n\nHello, I'm Derek.\n\nSo I made one: Derek.\n\nI'm her boyfriend, and she made me.\n\nHe's so nice.\n\n[laughs]\n\nWhoa, look at this glass.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nI'm in there, too?\n\nWhat's going on right now?\n\nIt's my first time making someone, so he might be a little bit off.\n\nLook, this could be...\n\nno, please put that down.\n\nThis could be very dangerous.\n\nIt shouldn't even be possible.\n\nWell, maybe not reboots ago, but apparently now it is.\n\n- [gasps]\n\n- [laughs]\n\nCan you believe this?\n\n- Derek... is it Derek?\n\n- It's Derek.\n\nDerek, could you please give me and Janet a moment alone?\n\nGo back to the void, babe. I'll be there in a minute.\n\nOkay. I'll miss you like crazy.\n\n- I'll miss you more. - No. I'll miss you more.\n\nBye!\n\n[laughs]\n\nWhat a dork, am I right?\n\n[giggles]\n    ]"},{number:7,title:"Derek",summary:"Eleanor Shellstrop

aren't you?\n\nI am a bit, actually.\n\nAll this time indoors has degraded my skin from radiant to merely dewy.\n\nMe?\n\nDewy?\n\nWell, there is going to be plenty of sun and fun at the private campsite that I set up for you at the edge of the neighborhood.\n\nHere you go.\n\nI told Vicky that I'll be torturing you for the time being so just relax.\n\nLive it up.\n\nOut you go, here.\n\nNow sadly, Janet is still offline so you can't call her, okay?\n\nThe best news is none of this is suspicious.\n\nI don't know what's going to happen to us,\n\nbut I need to tell you something.\n\nI love you.\n\nWhat are you watching?\n\nUm, \"Cannonball Run II.\" Again?\n\nYou watch that movie a lot.\n\nWell, it's basically my favorite movie of all time.\n\nBut you can never watch it.\n\nThis copy's

someone is to make your life easier?\n\nThat's okay, right?\n\nIs there a problem here, bud?\n\nOkay, I'll just tell you.\n\nUm...\n\nNo, too hard to explain.\n\nI'll show you.\n\nJanet.\n\n- Hi, there.\n\n- Hey, there!\n\nWho the fork is that?\n\nDerek Hoffstetler, P.I.\n\nDerek is my rebound guy.\n\nI made him.\n\nOh.\n\nDid you do that because of what I said?\n\nYes, because of what you said.\n\n- Janet...\n\n- Thank you, Eleanor.\n\nThank you, Eleanor.\n\nYou know, you seem so sad.\n\nDo you want me to make you a boyfriend too?\n\n- Ooh, I could have a brother?\n\n- Yes!\n\nBased on your last , comments, it would be Stone Cold Steve Austin's head on Tahani's body.\n\nOr vice versa.\n\nShe's not going to make you anything.\n\n- Janet, that will be all.\n\n- Okay, goodbye.\n\n- Say \"goodbye,\" Derek.\n\n- Ah, good-bob.\n\nI hope we same place again very now.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nHis brain is wrong.\n\n[both laugh]\n\n- Mmm.\n\n- Mm.\n\nNow, the goal is to tap the ball hard enough

here's where I am on this: We got to k*ll Derek.\n\nNo, think about it.\n\nWhat if Vicky calls for Janet, and Derek shows up too?\n\nShe's got to have a lot of questions that we can't answer.\n\nBut Derek does seem to be helping Janet get over Jason.\n\nRight?\n\nNo earthquakes since he showed up.\n\nIf we get rid of Derek, then maybe Janet will start glitching again...\n\nOkay, if we can't k*ll Derek, then we've got to break up Jason and Tahani.\n\n\n\nIf that relationship ends, then Janet won't feel sad anymore, and maybe she'll get rid of Derek herself.\n\nGirl, you are a messy bench who loves drama, - and I am into it.\n\n- I'm sorry, Michael, but that's also ethically kind of dicey.\n\nHere comes the egghead.\n\nWell, look, Jason and Tahani are happy together, and telling them that he was once married to Janet might cause them harm.\n\nIt's not permissible to ruin their happiness to save ourselves.\n\nWait, but isn't keeping a secret from someone basically like lying though?\n\nNo, no, it's okay to keep a secret as long as that secret isn't harming anyone, and telling them that secret might cause harm.\n\n- Noice!\n\n- Cool.\n\nGood point, egghead.\n\nI'll tell you what else would cause them harm, getting caught and being sent to the real Bad Place to be tortured for eternity, which will happen if Derek blows our cover.\n\nI know, but we'll also be sent to the real Bad Place if we do bad things.\n\nI know it's tempting to take a short-cut, but moral strength is defined by how we behave in times of stress.\n\nHas anyone ever told you what a drag you are?\n\nEveryone.\n\nConstantly.\n\n[imitates a trumpet]\n\nI hereby pronounce you King Jason.\n\nDope.\n\nWhere did you learn how to do this?\n\nThe Hertfordshire Academy for Expressionless Girls.\n\nIt was a finishing school I attended before Oxford, and then, of course, the Sorbonne.\n\n\n\nDo you know what, I don't think I ever asked you were educated.\n\nI went to Lynyrd Skynyrd High School in Northeast Jacksonville, which was really just a bunch of tugboats tied together.\n\nDidn't you get seasick?\n\nNo, sorry...\n\nthey were tied together in a junk yard.\n\nIt wasn't a very good school.\n\nFor most of my classes, we just sold dirty magazines door-to-door.\n\nYou know, Jason, every single detail about your life is...\n\ndeeply disturbing.\n\nAnd yet, I envy you.\n\nI was never allowed to goof off.\n\nNever even had a friend I could just be myself around.\n\nMaybe I can be that friend.\n\nOr your husband.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nOkay, stop it.\n\nNo, no, no, I'm serious.\n\nWill you marry me?\n\nI say we just let sleeping dogs lie.\n\nTell Janet that Derek can stay, but she's got to keep him under wraps so that none of the other demons find out.\n\nFine.\n\nAs long as they fly under the radar and Janet stays happy, I think we'll be safe.\n\n- Janet.\n\n- [both shouting]\n\n- How could you do this.\n\n- You don't respect me, and you never have!\n\nBecause to you I will always be that guy you made.\n\n- Guys, what's going?\n\n- Okay, can we not do this in front of my friends?\n\nOh, so they're your friends now.\n\nI'm stating a fact.\n\nThey are your friends!\n\nI don't know these people.\n\nI am out of here.\n\nOh, great, Derek.\n\nI'm going to go back to our void, and I'm going to try to forget this ever happened.\n\nIt is not your void.\n\nIt is my void.\n\nI know it's a boundless, barren nothingness, but you are always there.\n\nFine.\n\nI'll go somewhere else.\n\n- Fine!\n\n- No, no, not fine.\n\nDon't go somewhere else.\n\nOkay...\n\nyeah...\n\nWe're forked here, aren't we?\n\nLook, Jason, you're lovely, and I've honestly had a wonderful time with you these past few weeks, but why on Earth would I marry you?\n\nWell, for one thing, we're not on Earth.\n\nDecent point.\n\nAlso, we like each other, and I promise to always be nice to you.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'll marry you.\n\nBut I need some time to plan a proper reception.\n\nI mean, where will everyone sit?\n\nWill it be Michael and Janet opposite Chidi and Eleanor or Michael and Eleanor opposite Janet and Chidi?\n\nLet's have it today at the beach.\n\nThe beach is where all the best stuff happens like...\n\nswimsuit issues and...\n\n\"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Jersey Shore\" and...\n\n- crabs!\n\n- Okay.\n\nOh, I hope Janet's back online.\n\n- Janet.\n\n- Hi, there.\n\nIs everything all right, Janet?\n\nYeah, mm-hmm, everything is fine, it's okay, yeah.\n\nI'm fine.\n\nSo, it's all fine.\n\n[fake laughs]\n\nHow can I help you?\n\n- [gasps]\n\n- There he is!\n\nDerek.\n\nHow are you?\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nDerek, get down from there.\n\nI am not coming down because I meant to come here.\n\nI came here on purpose because this tree is my new house.\n\nThis is Derek's house, and Janet's not allowed in because I booby trapped it.\n\n- Hi.\n\n- Janet!\n\nOh, my God, you're here, thank God.\n\nDerek, I am not talking to you right now.\n\nI'm here to announce that Jason Mendoza and Tahani Al-Jamil are getting married this evening.\n\n\"The ceremony will be private, \"but we think it would be totally dope \"if you biz-natches came and got turnt up with us afterward.\" I think I can guess who wrote the invitation.\n\n\n\nHow come you never get this upset at anything I do, Janet?\n\nDo not start with me right now, Derek.\n\nOh, I will start it.\n\n- No, no.\n\n- Don't.\n\nDo not avoid me by going to the void.\n\n- No, no!\n\n- No, no, no!\n\n- What a little bench!\n\n- [groans]\n\nThings are falling apart here.\n\nChidi...\n\nI understand the ethics involved, but we need to stop that wedding.\n\nWe break up Jason and Tahani.\n\nJanet stops being sad.\n\nDerek goes away.\n\n- Fine, but...\n\n- [both groan]\n\nThere is something called the Doctrine of Double Effect.\n\nIn order to remain ethical, you can't just go into this with the intention of k*lling Derek.\n\nYour only goal has to be to spare Jason and Tahani from future pain by filling them in on Jason's past.\n\nNo, I got you, I got you.\n\nSo, it's like...\n\nethically we should tell Jason that he used to be married to Janet, and it sure would be terrible if that ultimately led to Derek's death, wink.\n\nNo, the winking is bad.\n\nYou should not be winking or saying the word \"wink.\" Okay.\n\nWe really need to k*ll...\n\nWe really need to k*ll any suspicion that I want to m*rder Derek.\n\nBoom!\n\n- Wink.\n\n- No.\n\nTahani, you're so smart.\n\nEvery day you teach me something new about...\n\nart...\n\nand history...\n\nand why you shouldn't eat everything that smells good because sometimes, it's candles.\n\nYou're basically, like, a hot genius teacher who sometime has sex with me, your student.\n\n\n\nThat used to happen a lot at Lynyrd Skynyrd High School, but this time you won't be arrested.\n\nOh, I love you, Tahani.\n\n[imitates g*n sh*ts]\n\nPew!\n\nPew!\n\nJason...\n\nI'd never guess we would be where we are today, me, a prominent British philanthropist with award-winning legs set to marry you, a swamp dweller who once asked me if the Presidents on Mount Rushmore have butts on the other side.\n\nWe don't make any sense together, and yet, when I'm with you, I can really let my hair down, metaphorically speaking of course, because I'd never have it up in the first place.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nI'm not a factory worker.\n\nBut you've helped me to see that there is more to life than just appearances, and I can't believe I'm about to say this but...\n\n- I think I love...\n\n- Wait!\n\nStop the ceremony!\n\n- This wedding cannot happen.\n\n- This is not helpful, but I have always wanted to be a part of a wedding that was stopped dramatically.\n\nWe can't get married?\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause...\n\nBecause...\n\nHang on a second.\n\nI can't do it.\n\nProfessor Buzzkill got in my head.\n\nI'm just thinking about all the rules I have to follow to stay ethical.\n\nSomeone else is going to have to do this.\n\n- I can't, no...\n\n- All right, all right.\n\nI hate the be the bearer of bad news...\n\nUh, I think you mean \"Bad News Bear.\" Before all the reboots, Jason was married to Janet.\n\nOkay?\n\nThat's why Janet's been glitching because she's sad 'cause she misses Jason, In fact, she was so sad she...\n\nWell...\n\nDerek.\n\nWell, well, well.\n\nJason Mendoza.\n\nAt last we meet.\n\nYou've got a lot of nerve buddy.\n\nNo, no.\n\nI'm Eleanor, man.\n\nEverybody, this is Derek.\n\nJanet made Derek as a boyfriend to try and rebound from Jason.\n\nOh, I feel quite light-headed.\n\nJanet, fetch my tizzy couch please.\n\nDecision time.\n\nAny second now someone is going to realize we're all missing.\n\nWhy don't you just reboot all of us?\n\nTahani and Jason will forget they were ever in love.\n\nIt was a flukey thing.\n\nIt probably won't happen again, and Chidi and I can forget...\n\nanything we want to forget.\n\nYou know, just like, uh...\n\npersonal bloopers that were embarrassing or...\n\nuh, days we were very gassy, et cetera.\n\nAnd then, we'll meet back in your office.\n\nYou bring us up to speed, and we go from there.\n\nNo, no, no, we are not starting over.\n\nWe've come too far.\n\nOur only options are to reboot either Janet or Derek.\n\nNeither one is permissible as your primary intention.\n\nI mean, the Doctrine of Double Effect, remember?\n\nWell, man, I'm working with a doctrine of not being completely effed, okay?\n\nI don't understand what you even like about Jason.\n\nWhat does he have that I don't have?\n\nA soul...\n\nand genitals.\n\n[groans]\n\n\n\nHere we go with this whole \"no genitals\" thing again.\n\nYou're the one that gave me wind chimes instead of a p*nis, Janet.\n\nThis isn't about your wind-chime p*nis.\n\nIn fact, it's not about you at all.\n\nI don't even know what it is about which is very confusing because the whole point of me is that I know everything!\n\nJanet, can I speak to you alone for a second?\n\nOkay, look, when you said you were sad about Jason and I suggested, \"hey, find a rebound guy,\" it's 'cause I thought it was some sort of schoolgirl crush, like, just some guy you made out with a couple of times in the walk-in freezer of a Bruegger's Bagels.\n\n- Not based on a real example.\n\n- Yes, it is.\n\nHis name was Marcus Bitsburger.\n\nMarcus?\n\nI always called him Ben.\n\nLook, I gave you bad advice, okay?\n\nJason was clearly important to you, and real heartbreak doesn't have a simple cure.\n\nI mean, you will feel better after some time goes by.\n\nI don't really experience the passage of time.\n\nI do use it as lotion occasionally.\n\nI mean, weird, but keep doing it because your skin looks amazing.\n\nThank you.\n\nNot skin.\n\nThe point is, to get through a real heartbreak, you kind of just have to sit with your feelings and mull it over and power through.\n\nAnd you have to talk about it.\n\n[groans]\n\nTalking about your feelings is the worst.\n\nIt's so much easier just to find a rebound guy and have sex about your feelings.\n\nI don't know if I want to talk to Jason right now.\n\nThat's cool.\n\nUntil then...\n\nIf you ever need a friend to talk to...\n\nJust know I'm here.\n\nDerek.\n\nThere's no easy way to say this.\n\n- I never should have made you.\n\n- [chuckles]\n\nI think it's time for you to go away.\n\nI understand because you understand.\n\nJanet, this relationship has been the best seven hours of my whole life.\n\nIt's been the only seven hours of my whole life.\n\nI made you this morning.\n\nWe all remember.\n\n- Okay, you ready to do this?\n\n- Yep.\n\nJanet.\n\n- What are you doing?\n\n- I imbued Derek with some of my thoughts and emotions.\n\nThis is the only way I can reabsorb them.\n\nIt will just be a minute.\n\nDang it.\n\nThat is some hot reabsorbing.\n\nCan you get pregnant from reabsorbing?\n\n[wind chimes ringing]\n\nUh-oh, I hear wind chimes.\n\nLook away.\n\nEverybody look away.\n\nI'm going to keep watching, but you guys look away.\n\n- [chuckles]\n\n- Goodbye, Derek.\n\nGoodbye, mommy-girlfriend.\n\nBye, everybody.\n\nDerek's going away now.\n\nDoes he seem a little bit uh...\n\nstill alive?\n\nWell, he's about as dead as he can be.\n\nKind of like he's in power-saver mode.\n\nDerek.\n\nAre you worried you might start glitching again?\n\nNo, I think I'll be okay now that I understand what I'm going through, and now that I know I can talk to my friends about it.\n\nOkay, I'm going to toss this steamer trunk containing the lifeless husk of my ex-boyfriend into a remote corner of my limitless void.\n\n- Bye, guys.\n\n- Derek!\n\n[sighs]\n\nI'\n\nMe too.\n\nPerhaps we were rushing things a bit.\n\nI mean, we don't even know that much about each other.\n\nLike, who was the first person you kissed?\n\nThe sexy mouse robot in the Chuck E.\n\nCheese band.\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nI think that's probably enough getting to know each other for now.\n\nWe'll just take things slow.\n\nI know I'm technically married to Janet, but I don't remember it at all.\n\nI'm sorry that it puts you in a weird position, and I still like you a lot.\n\nMe too.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nDon't know.\n\nDo you want to try...\n\nreabsorbing me?\n\n[laughs]\n\n- Is something wrong?\n\n- No.\n\nYep.\n\nI've been keeping a secret from you.\n\n- About you.\n\n- What is it?\n\nThe thing is, it's not even harming you, and if I tell you, I feel like it might harm you.\n\nSo, uh, ethically speaking, I don't think I have to tell you.\n\nYeah, well, forget all that.\n\nThis is freaking me out.\n\nI'm losing my mind.\n\nSo just tell me.\n\n\n\nAnd you don't need to respond because...\n\nI know you have trouble saying how you feel...\n\nI love you too.\n\nI've never been that certain about anything.\n\nI once even tried to...\n\nrent socks.\n\nHow did I...\n\nsay that...\n\nthat easily.\n\nI mean, I get how you said it.\n\nI'm a total smokeshow.\n\nBut how did I say it so easily?\n\nLook, I don't want to talk about this, but after everything that's happened today, I think we gotta.\n\nSo, let's just get it all out there.\n\nUm...\n\nWell, yeah, I guess, do you...\n\nI don't know...\n\ndo you have any feelings like that for me again, now?\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't think I do?\n\nSorry?\n\nWhy are you sorry?\n\n'Cause I'm relieved, because I don't either.\n\nSo, all good.\n\nI mean, I feel incredibly close to you...\n\nNo, no, no, no...\n\ndude, dude...\n\nyou don't need to explain yourself.\n\nWe are on the same page, okay?\n\nGood.\n\nHey guys, sorry.\n\nI know it's late.\n\nCan I talk to Eleanor for a second?\n\nActually, we're chatting about something right now.\n\nNo, it's cool.\n\nWe were wrapping it up.\n\nGood talk, bro.\n\n- What's on your mind?\n\n- Um, well...\n\nbeing ethical...\n\nit's hard, and I kind of hate it.\n\nWhen's it get easier?\n\nWhy don't you ask Chidi?\n\nHe's the ethics master.\n\nI'm just a newbie, and I still kind of suck at it.\n\nYeah, that's why I'm asking you.\n\nI designed this entire t*rture chamber around the absolutely certainty that when the going got tough, you would give up.\n\nThat was the signature Shellstrop move.\n\nDo you remember once when your change oil light came on?\n\nYou just abandoned your car in a parking garage.\n\nOf course.\n\nBut here, faced with the toughest challenges I could throw at you, you never once stopped trying to become a better person.\n\nAnd I just...\n\nWhy?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI mean, whenever I would do something crappy on Earth, there would be a little tiny voice in the back of my head that would say, \"Eleanor, \"don't grab that handful of olives from the salad bar.\n\nYou know, you didn't pay for that,\" or \"Eleanor, don't spit those olive pits onto the floor of the grocery store.\n\nThat's not cool.\" Or \"Eleanor, that old man just slipped on your olive pit, \"and he fell down.\n\n\n\n\"Don't use the fact that everyone's distracted to go back and steal more olives.\" - I get it.\n\n- This ethics stuff, it's hard, and it's confusing.\n\nIt is such a buzzkill.\n\nBut, it does get rid of the little voice.\n\nBecause at least I'm trying to do the right thing instead of the crappy thing, and I've got to say, man, I don't miss the little voice.\n\nWell...\n\nThank you for helping me today.\n\nWow.\n\nYou really did just come here to chat, didn't you?\n\nJust sh**t' the shirt with your old pal Eleanor.\n\nI guess so, yeah, why?\n\nIt's just a very human-y thing to do.\n\nStick with the program, demon buddy.\n\nI really feel like things are starting to click in our little study group.\n\nHmm.\n\nHello, Michael.\n\nShut the door.\n\nHave a seat.\n\n[dramatic

finding out I was married to Janet and then Janet making a boyfriend to forget me and then Janet getting rid of that boyfriend?\n\nOr do you mean when we saw that cool cloud?\n\nThe first bit.\n\nPerhaps later after Michael briefs us on how we're gonna be fake-tortured today, we can just sit down and have a chat?\n\nYes, good idea.\n\n- Yo, Chidi.\n\n- Yeah?\n\nYou wanna hear about a cool cloud I saw?\n\n[PLAYFUL MUSIC]\n\nCome in.\n\n\u266a\n\nI'd like to start by saying something I've wanted to say for a very long time.\n\nSurprise, idiots!\n\nYou're all in the Bad

revealing this now?\n\nWell, it was an experiment, and it worked, so my boss is promoting me.\n\nSorry, I should've introduced you.\n\nThis is my boss, Shawn.\n\nHello, imbeciles.\n\nWe need to study everything that happened here.\n\nThere was a first version that collapsed, but the second has been a huge success.\n\nWe'll be shutting this place down.\n\nThe four of you will be brought to the real Bad Pace, where your brains will be removed, studied, and batted around a stadium like beach balls.\n\nYour arms will be peeled like bananas.\n\n- That part's just for fun...\n\n- Right.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nAnd then you will be, you know, tortured forever.\n\nMichael, is this all true?\n\nYes, Eleanor, it is.\n\nYou're such a rube, thinking you could become a better person.\n\nYou got Chidi to teach you stupid philosophy...\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nLike those old farts were gonna provide guidance.\n\n\"Oh, Kierkegaard is so great.\n\nHave you read 'Fear and Trembling'?\" Well, I don't know, have you read \"Boring and Stupid\"?\n\nBecause that's what you are.\n\n- Nice.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nHow long will it take you to shut down the neighborhood?\n\nBetter part of a day, I'd guess.\n\nIn the meantime, why don't we have a farewell party here tonight?\n\nYou know, just to thank the crew for all the hard work.\n\n\n\nWe could jam to some tunes, you know, destroy the place, play beer pong with Jason's testicles.\n\n- What do you say, boss?\n\n- Sure.\n\nBy the way, I know what you're thinking.\n\n- \"Maybe Janet can help.\" - Ah.\n\nYou're wrong.\n\nJanet?\n\n[GASPS]\n\nOh, hi, you little cuties.\n\n[GIGGLES]\n\nI love you guys so much, except for you, Jason, because I hate you.\n\n[GIGGLES]\n\n- I hate you.\n\n- Janet, what's wrong?\n\nOoh!\n\nWhere's my phone?\n\nWe put a restraining bracelet on her, disrupting her powers.\n\n[GIGGLES]\n\nIt's made of mag-a-nets.\n\nMag-a-nets.\n\n- Mag-a-ne-its.\n\n- [CHUCKLES]\n\nMagnets are supposed to make me feel drunk, but guess what, I feel fine.\n\n[GIGGLING]\n\nI can't believe Michael betrayed us again.\n\nWhy is it always the ones you most expect?\n\nWe should've seen this coming.\n\nNo one can ever truly turn over a new leaf.\n\nSure, Ben Affleck told me he'd matured as an artist after he directed \"Argo,\" but then, right on schedule, it was, \"Guess what, Tahani, I'm gonna be Batman.\" There's only one option.\n\nSean clearly doesn't know that Michael has rebooted this neighborhood times.\n\n\n\nI say we trade that information for some kind of reduced sentence.\n\nChidi, they're monsters.\n\nWho's to say they won't agree to a deal, hear what we have to say, and turn around and install us into their horrible human zoo?\n\nThere's no other option.\n\nThere's no way for a human to get that bracelet off of Janet.\n\nBut if there were, we could get her to call us a train to Mindy St.\n\nClaire's house.\n\nWe know for a fact that the people from the Bad Place can't follow us there, and I vote for that.\n\nI vote we...\n\nNo, sorry, and no offense, Jason, but the stakes here are too high to let someone with your limited intellectual processing capacity weigh in.\n\n- I was gonna agree with you.\n\n- Oh, great, well, that's two votes for my plan.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nEleanor, what do you think?\n\nTrade information on Michael or try to escape to the Medium Place?\n\nNeither.\n\nI vote we ignore everything Michael just said and blindly assume he's still on our side.\n\nWho's with me?\n\nSorry, but when all this started, you're the one who told us that Michael wasn't trustworthy.\n\nNow you want us to trust him?\n\nYes, for one very specific and rock-solid reason: - What's-his-name.\n\n- Who?\n\nThe dude, the super depressing religious guy.\n\nThe...\n\nthe real buzzkill whose name I can never remember.\n\nKeeblers...\n\ncar.\n\nKyra.\n\nSedgwick?\n\nOh, I love her.\n\nDear friend of mine.\n\nNot important right now.\n\n- Kierkegaard?\n\n- Yes, Kierkegaard.\n\nWhen Michael was mocking us about trying to become better people, whose name did he use, huh?\n\nKierkegaard.\n\nI think he was sending us a message to take a leap of faith, 'cause that was Kierkegaard's thing, right?\n\nYes, although it's probably better translated as a leap into faith.\n\nIt's so hard to be your friend.\n\nYep, sorry.\n\nMichael was telling us to trust him.\n\nI had a long talk with him the other night about the whole Derek incident.\n\nDude was shook, talking about ethics and all spiraling about human stuff.\n\nI think he's on our side.\n\nOr maybe he's a supernatural demon designed to t*rture people, who just got offered his dream job, and has flipped on us like a ten-stone griddle chip.\n\nIt's a large pancake.\n\nCome on, people, you can get these from context.\n\nLook, maybe Michael jumped back to the dark side, but I don't think so.\n\nI think he's gonna help us escape.\n\nI know it sounds crazy, but if it weren't crazy, they wouldn't call it a leap of faith.\n\nThey would call it a...\n\nsit of doubting.\n\nI never thought I'd be the one to say it, but this is getting out of hand.\n\nI think we gotta go to the cops.\n\nWhat cops?\n\nWhere do you think we are?\n\n[PLAYFUL MUSIC]\n\nBefore tonight's party, I'd love to talk more about your strategy for torturing Tahani.\n\nI'm impressed you were able to make her fall in love with Jason.\n\n- She must be miserable.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nHumans make a lot of mistakes when they're horny.\n\n\u266a\n\nUh, boss, give me a second here.\n\n\u266a\n\n- What the here, dude?\n\n- Vicky...\n\nMy hard work paid off for you, and now you're just taking all the credit.\n\nVicky, Vicky, this can work out great for both of us if we play our cards right.\n\n\n\nShawn thinks that this is attempt number two, right?\n\n\n\nNow, if I tell him that you've been in charge of this version, he's eventually gonna find out that there've been hundreds of failed versions.\n\nOh...\n\nright.\n\nAnd if that happens, we're all going down.\n\n- [SIGHS]\n\n- So, spread the word.\n\nNo one talks about the reboots.\n\nFine, but you better make this right.\n\nMama want promotion, ya heard?\n\n[INDISTINCT CHATTER]\n\n\u266a\n\n- Hello, you dummies!\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\nThis neighborhood was a labor of hate for many people here, so I thought

guy in the world, but he is the dumbest guy in the world.\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\n- Oh, Jason, buddy, all you had to do was to keep quiet, but you couldn't stop talking about Kendall Jenner or that dumb quarterback...\n\nwhat was his name?\n\nDerek Bortles?\n\nAlways ranting about Derek Bortles.\n\nLucky for you, my friend, Jaguars games are the only ones televised in the Bad Place, because they suck!\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nNo, they don't.\n\nAll we need is a defense and an offense and some rule changes.\n\nDon't take it personally.\n\nHe just has to put on a show for the other demons.\n\nTahani Al-Jamil, elegance, grace, sophistication, but enough about your sister.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nYou know what the worst moment of Tahani's life was?\n\nWhen the last song played at one of her parties, and she would run off and cry because she still hadn't won her parents' approval.\n\nYou know the other worst moment of Tahani's life?\n\nEvery other moment of her empty, pointless life!\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\n- Hey-oh!\n\nI see Eleanor Shellstrop is here.\n\nEleanor and I have a lot in common.\n\nNow, here's how you can tell us apart: one of us is a manipulative demon who's an expert at making other people miserable, and then the other one...\n\nis me!\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nYou thought you deserved a Medium Place like Mindy St.\n\nClaire?\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nYou're bad, Eleanor.\n\nThis is exactly the place you should be.\n\nNot super funny for a roast there, bud.\n\nOh, sorry, you want a joke?\n\nOkay, you love Chidi, and Chidi doesn't love you back.\n\n- Boom!\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\nNow, that's funny, because it's very cruel and humiliating.\n\nI consider you one of my closest friends...\n\n- Not now, dude.\n\n- \"Speaking of Chidi\" is something no one has ever

wound up under the trolley?\n\nBecause all your students did.\n\n- Whoo!\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\nOh, Chidi, sorry, I got a joke for you, bud.\n\n- Uh, knock knock.\n\n- Who's there?\n\nYou died alone,

it bites me in the ash.\n\nI guess Michael really did flip back to the bad side.\n\nOh, does one think?\n\nThat roast was the meanest thing I've ever seen, and I once saw a waiter bring Russell Crowe the wrong tea.\n\nWell, we have no choice.\n\nWe go to Shawn, and we tell him that we'll trade secret information about the reboots, if he'll go easy on us, and if that doesn't work, we try to get Janet free and head to Mindy's.\n\nAgreed?\n\nYeah, Michael sucks now.\n\nHe pretended to be our friend.\n\nHe's gonna t*rture us for eternity.\n\nAnd you know what the worst part is?\n\nHe doesn't remember the name of my favorite football player.\n\nDefinitely not the worst part.\n\nIt is to me.\n\nBlake Bortles is a cool name.\n\nDerek Bortles is a dumb name.\n\n[ELMO & PATSY'S \"GRANDMA GOT

it out.\n\nKierkegaard, baby!\n\nLeap of faith.\n\nIt's better translated as a leap into faith.\n\nYou remembered!\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nCan somebody please explain what happened, and...\n\nand can you guys just be a tiny bit quieter?\n\nBecause, um, I've been drunk on magnets all day, and...\n\nand I can literally hear every sound in the universe.\n\nBasically, Michael sent us a code, and we had to crack it.\n\nI figured out the first clue...\n\n- No, you didn't, I did.\n\n- I was there, though!\n\n- Ooh...\n\n- Blake Bortles is a cool name.\n\nDerek Bortles is a dumb name.\n\nYes...\n\nDerek Bortles is indeed a very dumb name.\n\nIt's a clue.\n\nThere's no way Michael would've forgotten the name Blake Bortles.\n\nYou say it a million times a day.\n\n- 'Cause he's the best.\n\n- No, he's not, and even I know that.\n\nMichael was telling us to use Derek, Janet's Derek, for something.\n\nThere were clues in the roast.\n\nEverybody, quietly but quickly head to the train station, but let's split up, so we don't draw attention.\n\n[CROWD HOLLERING]\n\nUgh, you guys are the worst conspirators.\n\nOkay, what else did Michael say in the roasts that might be meaningful?\n\nTahani, do you remember?\n\nWell, he said my entire life was pointless and empty.\n\nYeah, but did he say anything we don't already know?\n\nAnything that stood out?\n\nYou know what the worst moment of Tahani's life was?\n\nWhen the last song played at one of her parties, and she would run off and cry, because she still hadn't won her parents' approval.\n\nThat was odd.\n\nA host never runs off during their last song, because after it's over, you're supposed to act surprised when everyone drags you on stage and showers you with applause.\n\nMaybe Michael wanted us to wait until the end of the party, when everyone was at their most distracted.\n\nAnd use Derek to drive the train, because he has some of Janet's powers.\n\n- Janet!\n\n- Hi, hey, hey...\n\n- Janet...\n\n- Yeah?\n\nWe need you to go get Derek from your void.\n\nOkay.\n\nsh**t, where's my void again?\n\nI forget.\n\nOh, yeah, it's everywhere.\n\nOkay, hang on to your butt cheeks.\n\n- [DING]\n\n- Ugh, where is he?\n\n- [ITEMS

you do that?\n\n- [CHUCKLES]\n\nDerek.\n\n[ALL EXHALE ECSTATICALLY]\n\nWait...\n\nnobody get on that train.\n\n- Derek?\n\n- Why not?\n\nBecause of what Michael said to me.\n\nYou thought you deserved a Medium Place?\n\nYou're bad, Eleanor.\n\nThis is exactly the place you should be.\n\nDerek...\n\nMichael wants us to stay here for some reason.\n\nEleanor, we have a train, a conductor, and a safe destination.\n\nI'm going to tell you the same thing I told Pippa Middleton right before we went paragliding in Gibraltar.\n\n\"Let's go.\" - What?\n\nThat's what I said.\n\n- Guys, leap of faith.\n\nMichael said we shouldn't get on that train.\n\nAny minute now, those demons are gonna come looking for us.\n\nWhere are we supposed to hide?\n\n[GASPS]\n\nOh, no.\n\nNow, when you taught the Trolley Problem, did you secretly wish that it could be you who wound up under the trolley?\n\nBecause all your students did.\n\n- All aboard!\n\n- [SHUSHING]\n\nThe train is here.\n\n- It's a

solo mission.\n\nOh...\n\nmaximum Derek.\n\nDerek headed off, and when the new train arrived, the four of us crawled underneath before any of the drunk demons saw us.\n\nThat kept us from being detected\n\nwhen Bad Janet scanned the neighborhood.\n\nWe fooled those mofos like the chumps they are.\n\nWe got all four clues you left us.\n\nOh, that's great.\n\nWell, I mean, I actually left you more than , clues, because of how primitive your brains are, but I'm so glad you got enough to figure it out.\n\nWait, how did you escape detection, though?\n\nWell, I'm not ethically proud of this, but I framed Vicky.\n\nIt was pretty easy.\n\nI just kept whispering things into Janet's ear to make her paranoid.\n\nI'm sorry, wh-what did you whisper to me?\n\nI don't remember.\n\n[CROWD

I know that this version is the best version of myself?\n\nHow do I know it's not version # , or , or ?\n\nOr , or ?\n\nAnd then you get into the whole idea of consciousness.\n\nAnd I mean just forget about best.\n\nAnd what version of Chidi is even real?\n\nWhat happens here?\n\nDoes he eventually tire himself out?\n\nUsually, but this one seems to be getting stronger as he goes on.\n\nAnd this Chidi is an imposter!\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is pretty simple, bud.\n\nYou've been our teacher this whole time.\n\nAnd we are much better because of you.\n\nIf we're the best versions of ourselves, which that balloon just proved, then you definitely are.\n\nSo in a way, it doesn't matter if I was better in version or whatever, because the best version of me is just as much about my effect on the world

ethics, and you spent a lot of time together.\n\nOnce you handed him a tissue right before he sneezed, and that simple act of anticipating his needs made him fall for you.\n\n\n\nOne night you took a walk along the lake, and you had your first kiss, which: Gross.\n\nKissing is gross.\n\nYou just mash your food holes together.\n\nIt's not for that.\n\nAnyway, it just you know bloomed after

confusion!\n\nMichael, what's going on?\n\nThe problem isn't any of you.\n\nThis whole balloon thing is a fake.\n\nThe truth is, I have no idea how to get into the Good Place and I never have!\n\nWell, Michael's right.\n\nI'm angry and confused.\n\nSo months ago, when you said you had this whole complicated plan for getting us to the Good Place...\n\nIt was a lie.\n\nI assumed if I bought myself some time, I could figure out a way in.\n\nGuys, I tried a billion different ways.\n\nNot an exaggeration!\n\nI actually tried one billion and twelve different plans.\n\nBut the only way into the Good Place is by being a good person on Earth.\n\nThis is unforgivable.\n\nHow many times can you betray us?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI really am, because while I was searching for a way to get in, I was also taking your ethics classes, learning why it was bad to lie.\n\nSo not only did I fail at getting us into the Good Place, I also learned the error of my ways.\n\nReal rock bottom for a demon, I'll tell you.\n\nBut this was not t*rture.\n\nI was stalling!\n\nSo I could keep searching for a way in.\n\nI would've been happy if you were to live in this neighborhood forever, but then Shawn came and just ruined the whole thing.\n\nSo what happens now?\n\nShawn will eventually figure out you're not at Mindy's, and he'll realize that someone on the inside was helping you.\n\nSo you'll go to the real Bad Place forever, and I will be...\n\nbe retired.\n\nYou're...\n\nyou're mad at me.\n\nI'm not mad.\n\nI'm just disappointed.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nEveryone knows that's worse.\n\nSo this really is the end.\n\nCompletely out of options, are we?\n\nNot completely out of options.\n\nWe can do what the Shellstrops have always done when the chips are down.\n\nIgnore our problems, and drink heavily.\n\nJanet!\n\nA million bottles of your finest booze, please!\n\n[AL GREEN'S \"I WISH YOU WERE HERE\" PLAYING]\n\n\n\n- You all right?\n\n- Kind of.\n\nI asked Michael if I could pop the giant

is still on the table.\n\nAre you and me cool?\n\nNot exactly.\n\nI think perhaps given everything, it's best we end our relationship.\n\nIt's probably about time I stopped relying on others for my sense of self-worth or happiness.\n\n\n\nYou know my whole life, whenever I encountered any obstacles, I would simply say, \"I would like to speak to a manager.\" But in our relationship, there was no manager.\n\nThere was no one who could fix this for me except me.\n\nMy mom was a manager at a pet store.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nNo, and please don't launch into one of your long stories...\n\n- She got fired after I...\n\n- Please, no.\n\nRobbed the pet store where she worked.\n\n- Please, please, Jason.\n\n- We actually - robbed it together.\n\n- No, no, no.\n\nLong story short, it was all a

don't feel the same way.\n\nAnd although that fills me with anger and confusion...\n\nWow.\n\nMichael was right on the money.\n\nI just wanted you to know the truth.\n\nYou are...\n\nI mean...\n\nOh,

point is...\n\nthe circumstances under which me met are completely insane.\n\nAnd that just makes the grinding harder.\n\nI just wish we met the way normal people meet.\n\nLike at a philosophy

their admiration.\n\nThen I heard this little voice in my head saying, \"Tahani, don't do this.\" The little voice in your head sounds like the old lady from \"Downton Abbey.\" Oh, yeah, sorry.\n\nMaggie Smith is my godmother.\n\nAnyway, I took a deep breath, told them I ate a Cheeto, and walked away.\n\nMan.\n\nYou have made so much progress.\n\nI'm proud of you, hot

needed time to evaluate my complex feelings, but that was just a rationalization.\n\nThis might be the last time I ever get to talk to you, so there it is...\n\nI love you.\n\nAnd I hereby stop avoiding this topic and rationalizing by saying the situation is complicated.\n\nOr that my brain is grinding like a fork in a garbage disposal.\n\nAll right.\n\nWhatever.\n\nYou're not really a part

save your souls.\n\nFor the time being, The Judge is gonna put you in your own medium places, like Mindi St.\n\nClair.\n\nAnd while you're there, I'll keep working every angle I can think of to get you guys into the Good Place, for real.\n\nThis is great.\n\nSo we'd all be together?\n\nOh, no, that's the thing about Medium Places...\n\nit has to be tailored to what's medium for the

million years.\n\n- Yeah, give or take.\n\n- Yeah?\n\nSomewhere in there.\n\nCome on, you guys, I know this isn't perfect, but I need more time to build my case, and it's either this or back to the Bad Place.\n\nYeah.\n\nI'll say it.\n\nBoth those options suck.\n\nOkay, I'm sorry if that's blunt, Your Honor, but it's true.\n\nAlso, Chidi just laid one on me, so I'm kinda dizzy.\n\nYou two kissed?\n\nHot diggity dog!\n\nThat's what I said!\n\nThe point is, we've all gotten better.\n\nWhy should we have to go live alone in a boring void because of a messed-up system?\n\n- How is that justice?\n\n- Okay.\n\nSlow your roll there, Erin Brockovich.\n\nFirst of all, y'all didn't get good enough to pass the tests I just gave you.\n\nSecond, I still believe that the only reason that you improved in Michael's fake neighborhood is because you thought there was a reward at the end of the rainbow.\n\n\n\nYou're supposed to good things because you're good!\n\nNot because you're seeking moral desert.\n\nAnd I still believe that they would've become good people if they'd just gotten a...\n\n[DRAMATIC MUSIC]\n\nA push...\n\nin the right direction.\n\nOh, no.\n\nNope,

about, if there's a shotgun, I call shotgun.\n\nIt's never gonna work, man.\n\nIf it doesn't, then they go right back to the Bad Place.\n\n- [SIGHS]\n\n- No one gets hurt.\n\nExcept them,

somehow, like a tiara or one of those diagonal award belts...\n\n- Sash.\n\n- Sure.\n\nThen why should I do good things?\n\nYou know, I had a friend that said whenever she was doing something bad, she'd hear this...\n\nthis little voice in her head, distant little voice, saying, \"Oh, come on now.\n\n\n\nYou know this is wrong.\" And then when she started doing good things, that voice went away.\n\nIt was a relief.\n\nYour friend sounds like she's one pick short of a...\n\npickle party.\n\n[SNORTS]\n\nShe's a little rough around the edges, but she was also a really good person, when she

it is the question I will try to answer\xa0over the next three hours.\xa0Are you Chidi Anna...\n\nKendrick?\n\nAnagonye, and yes.\n\nGreat, hi.\n\nMy name is Eleanor Shellstrop.\n\n- Can we talk?\n\n- Sure.\n\nOkay, uh, where do I start?\n\nI'm not, like, the best person in the world.\n\nI'm a trash bag from Arizona, which is saying something.\n\nOur biggest exports are r*cist sheriffs and HPV.\n\nBut about a year ago, something crazy happened...\n\n[KNOCKING] And I...\n\n[BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH] Sorry.\n\nI've been flying for like, hours.\n\nThis is Australia, right?\n\nYes.\n\nI grew up in Senegal, so my native language is French.\n\nBut I went to American schools, so I also speak English.\n\n- Oh.\n\n- And German and Greek.\n\nAnd Latin, just in case it ever comes back.\n\nCool.\n\nI once got out of on a Buzzfeed quiz called \"Do you know all the slang words the Kardashians invented?\" - Congratulations?\n\n- Thank you.\n\nI'm going to be honest.\n\nI did cheat.\n\nBut you were saying something crazy happened to you?\n\nYes, uh, I almost died.\n\nAnd it made me want to become a better person, which I did for a while.\n\nBut then I fell back into my old trash bag ways.\n\nYesterday, I saw your lecture, and something just clicked.\n\nWait, you flew all the way here from Arizona just to see me?\n\nYou know what, don't flatter yourself, pal.\n\nSorry, that's a knee-jerk reaction.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did.\n\nAnd I know that seems zonk-atronic...\n\nthat's Khloe's word for crazy...\n\nbut I need someone to help guide me, morally speaking.\n\nAnd I think I need it to be you.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nWill you help me become a good person?\n\n[SOFT MUSIC] - Yes.\n\n- [CHUCKLES] \u266a \u266a [INHALES] I'll start you off with some introductory philosophy books, and then we'll meet here once a week.\n\nGreat.\n\nIdeally, some of those books will have been made into a movie or maybe a funny GIF.\n\nBut anything's good with me, man.\n\n- Can I ask you something?\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\nWhy are you helping me?\n\nI'm a teacher.\n\nThat's my job.\n\nYeah, but I'm not your student.\n\nI'm just some hot rando who walked in off the street.\n\nThere's got to be another reason.\n\nYes, there is.\n\nUm...\n\nI also had a near-death experience.\n\n- Whoa.\n\n- Well, I mean, I don't know for sure that I would have died, but, it was pretty nuts.\n\nI'm sorry, but this is an important moment in our friendship...\n\n- On your right, mate!\n\n- Oh, jeez.\n\n\xa0Watch\xa0it, man!\n\n[YELLS] Oh, my God.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nThat... that is right where I was standing.\n\nI was frozen here, unable to make a simple decision, and I almost got crushed by an air conditioner.\n\nThis is a sign.\n\nI shouldn't be using air conditioners.\n\nThe freon is awful for the environment.\n\nThat's the lesson you take from this?\n\nChidi, your brain is broken.\n\nYou need to fix your brain.\n\nSo in a nutshell, I have a , -page thesis\xa0that I am nowhere near finishing, I am absolutely paralyzed by decision-making, and it is destroying my life.\n\nYeah, I sort of got that when you couldn't choose a chair to sit on.\n\n\n\nWell, I didn't want to offend you in case you had a favorite.\n\nLook, I know I just kind of... nope... walked in here, and you don't know me at all, but is there any way to tell if my indecision is due to a brain thing?\n\nUm, yeah, sure.\n\nNow what we do is we make a lengthy incision from your eyebrows to the nape of your neck, and we peel your face back, right, then slice your skull open.\n\nAnd I just randomly s*ab at your brain with an electrified needle.\n\nThe fun part is you're awake the whole time.\n\nUh...\n\nI'm kidding!\n\nI'll just give you an MRI and look at the part of your brain that controls decision-making.\n\nOh, I want that.\n\nI need to learn about my brain, please.\n\nWell, so you just march into my office unannounced, tell me your brain is broken, then demand I drop everything and just put you in the university's $ million MRI machine?\n\nOh, I'm sorry, I just...\n\nI freaking love it.\n\nYou're so weird!\n\nLet's go.\n\n- Right now?\n\n- Oh, yeah, come on.\n\nOh... okay.\n\n[LIGHT MUSIC] This is your hippocampus.\n\nIt regulates memory.\n\nYours looks great, very strong.\n\nGorgeous hippocampus here!\n\n[BOTH LAUGH] This is your ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the center of decision-making.\n\nThis is where the magic happens.\n\nDo you see how it's all lit up?\n\nThat's a flurry of activity that occurred when I asked you to choose between red and blue, and you almost passed out.\n\nIs it too late to pick blue instead?\n\nIt is, yeah.\n\nThe point is, at first glance, your brain is very healthy.\n\nHuh, there are actual answers here, data you can observe and learn from.\n\nYeah, man, science is all about getting answers.\n\nYou philosophers can spend your entire life mulling over a single question.\n\nThat's why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.\n\n- [LAUGHS] - No offense.\n\nOh, none taken.\n\nWe suck.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- [BOTH LAUGH] [UPBEAT MUSIC] \u266a \u266a - Chidi.\n\n- One blueberry muffin, please.\n\nWhy choose to be good every day?\xa0I argue that we choose to be good\xa0because of our bonds with other people.\xa0Simply put, we are not in this alone.\n\nThank you.\n\n[APPLAUSE] Wow, Chidi.\n\nYou chose that muffin in less than a minute.\n\nThat beats your old record by minutes.\n\nHenry, I feel amazing.\n\nI am pages into my new thesis, and it is some of the best writing that I

beauty of it.\n\nAnyone can live this way.\n\nJust decide to be more decisive.\n\nLike, what's something that you've always wanted to do?\n\nI mean, I have been putting off getting in shape.\n\nThen make the decision to wake up tomorrow morning and get in shape.\n\nIt is that easy.\n\nOkay.\n\nMaybe I will!\n\n- What have you got to lose?\n\n- Nothing!\n\nHenry, what happened to you?\n\nWell, I was using the leg press at the gym, and you know how your legs bend a certain way?\n\nMy legs bend the other way now.\n\nOh, no.\n\nAll the tendons in my legs snapped like violin strings, and then, my foot flew forwards, and I kicked myself in the face, which gave me a concussion.\n\nBut on the bright side, I lost control of my bladder.\n\n\n\nSomeone got it on video, and now \"Leg Press Whizzer\" has , views on Youtube.\n\n- I'm famous.\n\n- This is all my fault.\n\nI did this to you.\n\nOh... oh, muffins!\n\nI brought blueberry muffins.\n\nOh, no, you shouldn't eat blueberries anymore.\n\nRead an article.\n\nThe migrant workers who pick them are horribly mistreated.\n\nYaaaaaaah!\n\n[BRIGHT MUSIC] Good morning, Chidi.\n\nBlueberry muffin for ya?\n\nUh, I don't know, maybe.\n\nI can't decide.\n\n- You all right there, mate?\n\n- Okay, I've made my decision.\n\nI want to...\n\nstart crying.\n\n[WHEELS SQUEAK] [BRIGHT MUSIC] Excuse me?\n\nWhat is the maximum number of books that I can check out?\n\n- Is it , ?\n\n- Got a wild weekend planned?\n\nWell, I need to find a new topic for my thesis, and I had this thing happen that made me more decisive, and a few months ago, my friend broke both of his legs, and it's my fault, and blueberries, and I need help.\n\n- Whoo!\n\n- Maybe that help will come from Tay Zonday's autobiography, \"Chocolate Book.\" I mean, who's to say?\n\nMate, I've worked in this library a long time, and I've seen a lot of academic types with that same helpless look on their faces.\n\nThey all made it through okay.\n\n- Once they learned the secret.\n\n- What's the secret?\n\nThere's a secret?\n\nIs the secret more books?\n\n- How many more books do I need?\n\n- It's not about books, mate.\n\nIt's about perspective.\n\nSometimes, when you're feeling helpless, the secret is to help someone else.\n\nGet out of your own head.\n\nTrust me.\n\nThe next time someone asks for help, say yes.\n\n[SOFT MUSIC] A few hours later, you walked in and asked for help.\n\nNow, I don't know if this is going to solve all of my problems, but it's worth a try, right?\n\nWell, thank you, sexy librarian guy.\n\nI didn't say he was sexy.\n\nOh, I know, but whenever anyone tells me a story about their life, I always imagine all the people as being super hot.\n\nOtherwise, I quickly lose interest.\n\nDo you not do that?\n\nYou can do it for free.\n\nI got to say, I enjoyed playing the role of mysterious librarian, and I really [BAD ACCENT] nailed the Australian accent.\n\n- Uh-huh, flawless.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nBut the point is, Eleanor and Chidi are together, and now we can relax.\n\nEverything is finally on track.\n\n[TENSE MUSIC] \u266a \u266a - Status report.\n\n- They're plugging away, but we

And then this doodle of a burrito because when I first read Aristotle, I thought it was pronounced like Chipotle.\n\nWait a minute, is it \"Chip-o-tottle\"?\n\nThese are all great questions.\n\nBut I have to meet my thesis adviser across campus.\n\nOh, well, I'm headed that way, too.\n\nI'll walk with you.\n\nHey, so, I've been trying to figure out how to pay you back for helping me.\n\nI told you, you don't owe me anything.\n\nAt home, when I want to get something nice for one of my friends, it usually comes in the form of something edible.\n\nYou get what I'm saying?\n\nAn \"edible\" thing?\n\n- Please don't buy me dr*gs.\n\n- Okay, copy that.\n\nI had no choice, I was in his driveway taking pictures when he walked out, so I said \"Hey, Mr.\n\nCrowe, I'm from the gas company.\" - \"I loved you in 'Gladiator.'\" - Chidi, hey!\n\n- Hey!\n\n- I got a question.\n\nIs it \"What's my thesis topic?\" - Because I still don't know.\n\n- No, it's not that.\n\n[LAUGHS] Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nYou guys haven't met yet.\n\n- Um, Simone, this is Eleanor.\n\n- The famous Simone.\n\n- Nice to meet you.\n\n- You too.\n\nSo I've got to do some MRI scans as a control for an experiment.\n\nAnd since you loved it so much last time, I was wondering if you could just pop back in there and help me out?\n\n- Oh, absolutely.\n\n- Cool, okay.\n\nWell, just come by my lab at : and then afterwards, I can buy you dinner as a thank you.\n\nOh, no, no, you don't have to do that.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nWell, uh, I'll see you later.\n\nNice to meet you.\n\n- You, too.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n[BRIGHT MUSIC] - What?\n\n- Uh, you and Simone had some real professor dork vibes flowing.\n\nYou're both teachers who are hot for teacher.\n\n[SQUEALS] How have you not asked her out yet?\n\n- Are you scared?\n\n- Well, it's not impressive to guess that I'm scared, Eleanor.\n\nI'm scared of everything, and I can't just do things like that.\n\n- Just drop it, okay?\n\n- Well...\n\nOkay, just promise me you'll drop it.\n\nOkay.\n\nI promise.\n\nSo you're into Chidi, right?\n\nI mean, forgive my bluntness, but I'm usually right about these things.\n\nWell, yeah, but I made it pretty clear a bunch of times, and he's never responded, so I just assumed he wasn't interested.\n\nOkay, I'm all set.\xa0I'm just going to ask you some basic questions, Chidi.\n\n\n\n- What is one plus one?\n\n- Two.\xa0- What color is the sky?\n\n- Blue.\xa0What color are Simone's eyes?\n\nBrown.\n\nUh...\n\nuh, what?\n\nIf you could take Simone anywhere on a date, where would you take her?\n\nSorry, is this part of the experiment?\n\nIt is now, yes.\n\nPlease answer the question.\xa0And keep in mind, we can see your brain.\xa0Next question.\n\nYou are into Simone.\n\n- That's not a question.\n\n- So you agree it's a fact.\n\nNext question's for Simone.\n\nSimone, are you annoyed at Chidi for waiting so long to ask you out?\n\n- Yes, I am.\n\n- Chidi, same question for you.\xa0Are you annoyed at yourself for waiting so long to ask out Simone?\n\nI mean, I'm annoyed with you, and I've only known you three weeks.\n\nYes, I am obviously very annoyed with myself.\n\nCan I get out now?\n\nNo, you can't.\n\nIt'll ruin the science.\n\nThere's only one question left, and you got to ask it, bud.\n\n[SOFT MUSIC] Simone, would you like to have dinner with me?\n\nWow, that is highly inappropriate.\n\n- Uh...\n\n- I'm just kidding.\n\nYes, I would.\n\nThank you for asking.\n\n- Aw, cute.\n\n- This is a disaster.\n\nMichael, relax.\n\nHow are the two of them going to bond?\n\nThere were plenty of reboots where Eleanor and Chidi weren't even soul mates, and he still always helped her.\n\nSimone and Chidi are good together.\n\nI've been running simulations on what their kids will be like.\n\nOne of them is hot enough to be on \"The Bachelor\" and smart enough to never go on \"The Bachelor.\" This is not just about Chidi.\n\nI've left too much to

realized I was practicing virtue ethics by helping the two of you bone down.\n\nOkay, not appropriate.\n\nAlso, not a great understanding of virtue ethics.\n\nOh, we can agree to disagree.\n\nBut if you must know, it was very chaste.\n\nWe didn't even kiss.\n\n- Because you chickened out?\n\n- I did!\n\nYeah, I totally chickened out, and I am so mad at myself.\n\nWell, hey, maybe it wasn't the right moment.\n\nKnowing the two of you nerds, your first kiss is going to be while reading Plato in an MRI machine.\n\n[CHUCKLES] Oh, hang on.\n\nCome with me.\n\nSimone, what's the one thing Eleanor

not mine.\n\n- Totally.\n\n- Who once told me that her greatest accomplishment was breaking into Charles Barkley's house.\n\nMm.\n\nHe was on the road.\n\nI snuck in through the doggy door.\n\nTried on all his giant shoes.\n\nOne of my top five Christmases.\n\nListen, the point is, Eleanor and I have nothing in common except that we both almost died, and it made us want to be better

Jason and I are straight trash.\n\n[caws]\n\nBut just, I mean, think about how much progress we've all made since that picture was taken.\n\nI know that what we're doing is important, and I'm not ready to stop.\n\nAnd I don't think you guys are, either.\n\nSo let's all stay here and keep it going.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nEleanor, that was absolutely lovely.\n\nIt really was, and I'm...\n\nI'm so glad that this study meant that much to you.\n\n- But, realistically...\n- That's cool, I get it.\n\nNo, you don't need to say it.\nI... I got it.\n\n- That's all she wrote, cool.\n- Are you okay?\n\n- I hope you're not mad.\n- No, I'm not mad.\n\nI'm actually laughing, because this whole study was a hilarious, stupid, pointless joke, and now it's over, so let's hit the road.\n\nI don't need you guys.\nYou don't need me.\n\nAnd since you don't need me, I'm just going to take the \"me\" out of this cake.\n\n- No, no.\n- [all gasp]\n\nEleanor, please!\n\n[mocking accent]\nOh, sorry, the deed is done.\n\nPip pip, too late.\n\nFarewell to you, my liege.\n\nAnd a jolly good Saint Ploopington's Day to all of you.\n\n[normal voice] USA! USA! USA!\n\n[soft whimsical music]\n\nEleanor? Is that you?\n\nNo.\n\nI called a cab like, minutes ago.\n\nIt says it's ten kilometers away, which is I don't even know how far.\n\nIt's a little over six miles.\n\nIs that why you came out here?\n\nTo scold me about the metric system?\n\nNo, I was about to call a cab myself.\n\nI have an early class tomorrow.\n\nThen, I saw my friend hiding behind a plant, and I got concerned.\n\nThen, my friend lashed out at me again, so I'm gonna take off, and uh, leave her here with dirty leaves in her hair.\n\nWait, wait, wait-wait-wait.\n\n- Wait-wait, I'm sorry.\n- [bottle clanks]\n\nI'm sorry. Don't go.\n\nYou're a brain scientist.\n\nCan you tell me why I did that in there?\n\nI mostly do clinical research in neuroscience.\n\nI don't really specialize in temper tantrums.\n\nMaybe you need a child psychologist.\n\nOr a binky.\n\nThat's a solid burn.\nI deserved it, I did.\n\nBut please, can you help me?\n\nWhy did I do that?\n\nOkay, here's my guess.\n\nAs humans evolved, the first big problem we had to overcome was \"me versus us.\"\n\nLearning to sacrifice a little individual freedom for the benefit of a group.\n\n\n\nYou know, like sharing food and resources so we don't starve or get eaten by tigers, things like that.\n\nOkay, with you so far.\n\nThe next problem to overcome was \"us versus them,\" trying to see other groups different from ours as equals.\n\nThat one, we're still struggling with.\n\nThat's why we have racism and nationalism and... why fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin hate fans of The Rock.\n\nNo, we hate The Rock because he went Hollywood, and Stone Cold keeps it real, so The Rock's fans are the real jabronis.\n\nPoint made. Keep going.\n\nWell, what's interesting about you is\n\nI don't think you ever got past the \"me versus us\" stage.\n\nI mean, have you ever been part of a group that you really cared about?\n\n- I was in the Girl Scouts.\n- Really?\n\nTechnically, I joined under a fake name because I wanted to steal a bunch of cookies.\n\nSee, the Brainy Bunch is basically the first group that became part of your self-identity.\n\n\n\nAnd now that's breaking up, you're feeling this new kind of loss, and you're scared of going back to being alone.\n\nI mean, that's just my guess.\n\nThe other possible medical diagnosis is that you're just a bit of a d*ck.\n\n[both laugh]\n\n[bright music]\n\nWhy don't you take my cab?\n\nI think me needs to go apologize to us.\n\nAnd thank you. [exhales]\n\nThe point is, I'm not really an \"I'm sorry\" type girl.\n\nI'm more of a \"it's your fault your car got keyed \"in the movie theatre parking lot because you wouldn't shut up while watching 'John Wick'\" type girl.\n\nBut I'm sorry that I freaked out.\n\nI'm just really going to miss you guys.\n\n- We're going to miss you, too.\n- Here's an idea.\n\nWhat if we all agree to a yearly reunion?\n\nAnd then that way, the Brainy Bunch never dies.\n\nEach summer, we can all stay in one of our respective houses, mega-yachts, ski chalets, what have you.\n\nWe should all meet up in Jacksonville.\n\nMy house is right on the water.\n\nIt didn't used to be, but the whole city is a swamp, and it's sinking into the ocean.\n\nWhoo, strong pitch, bud.\n\nNext year in Jacksonville.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh, we might not want to wait a whole year.\n\nIt's sinking really fast.\n\n- We should have a toast.\n- [exhales]\n\nOkay, I think I've figured out a plan where they stay in Australia, and only five random bystanders get hurt.\n\n- It's called arson.

I don't ca... there's got to be a way.\n\n- Michael, before you do this...\n- No, no more waiting!\n\nThis is all we have, Janet!\n\nWe have Chidi and Eleanor and Tahani and Jason, and that is it.\n\nIf we can't get them enough afterlife points to get them into the Good Place, then there's no point in us even being here.\n\nWe have to try.\n\nOkay.

I'm... my brain is melting.\n\nHow can events happen before the ones that happened... before?\n\nIt's just the way it works.\n\nIt's... it's Jeremy Bearimy.\n\nI don't know what to tell you.\n\nThat's the easiest way to describe it.\n\nOkay, but, um...\n\nwhat the hell is this?\n\nThe dot over the I...\nwhat the hell is that?\n\nOkay, um, how do I explain this concisely?\n\nThis is Tuesdays... and also July.\n\n- And sometimes it's never.\n- That's true.\n\nOccasionally that moment on the Bearimy timeline is the time-moment when nothing never occurs.\n\nSo... you get it.\n\nThis broke me!\n\nThe dot, over the I, that broke me. I'm...\n\nI'm done.\n\nYou know what? I'm glad this whole thing happened, because now I can go back to living my life the way I used to... only caring about myself because being good is pointless.\n\nNo, no. Please, Eleanor...\n\nNo, thank you. I'm outtie.\n\nSee you in hell.\n\n[gasps] You know what I just realized?\n\nI always say that when leaving a room, but right now it's accurate.\n\nI will literally see all of you in hell.\n\n- Not if I see you first.\n- Let's go, Jason.\n\nNo, no... look, look, you guys, this is not over.\n\nWe have to stay together!\n\nLook, we'll figure something out!\n\nLike, just one idea I had...\n\nI could k*ll all of you.\n\nThat's my birthday.\n\nHey, buddy. [clears throat]\n\nIt's my birthday.\nOne free margarita, please.\n\nHappy birthday!\n\nCan I just see some I.D.?\n\n- No.\n- Why not?\n\nWell, because it's not really my birthday.\n\nI just want a free margarita.\n\nWell, if I just randomly gave you a free drink, I'd have to do it for everyone.\n\nPretty soon I'd go out of business.\n\n[laughs] Then don't do it for everyone.\n\nJust do it for me because it's my birthday.\n\nHappy birthday.\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\nJason, I have an idea.\n\nBut it's a little risky.\n\nI need you to act as my bodyguard... like my friend, Kevin Costner, in that movie where he was a bodyguard...\n\n\"The Bodyguard.\"\n\nNo problem... my cousin once hired me to do crowd control for his off-brand SeaWorld.\n\nWell, technically, it was just a bunch of kiddie pools full of jellyfish, and instead of a k*ller whale, they k*lled a whale.\n\nExcuse me, miss.\n\nwe'd like to buy one opera, please.\n\nUh, what he means is I would like to give $ million to the Sydney Opera.\n\nMs. Al-Jamil, this is so generous.\n\nWith a donation of that size, we will dedicate a rehearsal hall in your honor.\n\nThank you, but, no.\n\nLovely as it sounds to add to my collection of wings and atria, the gift will be anonymous.\n\nAs you wish. I'll draw up the papers.\n\nWhy don't you want your name on the opera house?\n\nI love getting my name on stuff.\n\nIn Jacksonville, I got a flu virus named after me 'cause I kissed a bat on a dare.\n\nWell, I was thinking about why I was sent to hell, as one is wont to do when one has recently been told that one had been sent to hell, and it occurred to me, I have always been held c*ptive by my desire for attention.\n\n\n\nNow that I know how it all ends, I just want to be virtuous for virtue's sake.\n\nThat's beautiful.\n\nI got to say, though, if you want to do more charity, I know a way that could be a lot of fun.\n\n[chuckles]\n\n[gentle music]\n\nHey, you want to talk to God?\n\n\"God is dead.\n\n\"God remains dead, and we have k*lled him.\n\n\"Who will wipe this blood off us?\n\n\"What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent?\"\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, .\n\nI was just trying to sell you some dr*gs, and you made it weird!\n\n[sprinklers hissing]\n\nI've never written a manifesto before.\n\nWhat are you gonna say?\n\nIt will be a complete account of everything we've learned. from the beginning of my neighborhood to right now and then a recommendation of how we feel the afterlife\ncould be improved.

And, no.\n\nAnd you all get As or Fs.\n\nAnd there is no test.\n\nAnd you all failed it, and you all got As.\n\nWho cares? Good-bye.\n\n- [students murmuring]\n- Good-byyyyye.\n\nCool lecture.\n\nAnd cooler shirt.\n\nFeeling all right?\n\n- I feel fine.\n- Hmm.\n\nI do have a stomachache.\n\nWhy do I always have a stomachache?\n\nWell, you just ate pounds of chili, bro.\n\nThis one's on you.\n\nLook, I know the future seems bleak.\n\nBut I have a plan.\n\nCome with me.\n\nNo, ah, ah, leave that chili, weirdo.\n\nA complete account of every single thing we've done and learned.\n\nI added all the data we've gathered here on Earth in chart and in graph form.\n- Hmm.\n\nAnd I added a pretty tasty little recipe for cinnamon rolls made out of pizza dough.\n\n- [chuckles]\n- Ha!\n\nMaybe someone someday can learn from our mistakes.\n\nAnd enact real change in the process of judging people.\n\nBut for now, Janet, old friend, we are going to enjoy our time on Earth before we're retired.\n\n- Hmm.\n- So let's get started.\n\nI know it's touristy, but I'd really like to visit a LensCrafters.\n\nOoh, and I'd like to get bangs.\n\n[gasps] Hey, guys.\n\nIt... it's really nice to see you.\n\nUm... is everything okay...\n\nother than, you know, everything?\n\nWe've started to accept our fates.\n\nIt's all chili under the bridge.\n\nOh!

Wow, that's crazy! [whimpering]\n\nIt's strictly platonic, of course.\n\nWe only did it so I could legally give Jason half my money.\n\nWe just popped over to the British Embassy and signed the papers.\n\nThat's insane, but it's also, like... the th most insane thing to happen today,\n\nso... who cares?\n\nI need everyone to focus up.\n\nSo the four of us...\n\nthe six of us, really, are doomed.\n\nOur fates are sealed.\n\nBut I think we have one move left.\n\nWe can try.\n\nTry... what?\n\nTry to do good.\n\nThat stupid, little voice in my head told me to do something good today, and it was so annoying, but it also made a dork and his very untalented daughter super happy.\n\nMe trying just a little bit put some good out into the world.\n\nThe six of us are not getting into the Good Place.\n\nBut there are still people in this world that we care about, so I say we try and help them be good people.\n\nTry and help them get in.\nI mean, why not try?\n\nIt's better than not trying, right?\n\nThat's a lovely sentiment, Eleanor.\n\nLet's try. I'm in.\n\nI'm in, too.\n\nI'm gonna remember this day forever because of your dope speech and also because of the great tacos I had and also because I got married and I found out I was going to hell and also I became a hundred-millionaire...\n\nAll right, we get it. We get it.\n\nIt goes without saying that we're in.\n\nLet's say it anyway.\n\n- We're in...\n- We're...\n\nAll right, you go...\n\n- We're in...\n- We're in...\n\n[laughing] We're just so excited!\n\nWe're in!\n\nWhat do you say, bud?\n\nYou want to join the Soul Squad?\n\nTry to save some souls?\n\n- Yeah.

Turn around.\n\nIt's embarrassing.\n\nBing.\n\n[pleasant music]\n\nJacksonville, what up?\n\n- Duval!\n- ALL: Duval!\n\nPoor Larry.\n\nBut...\n\n\"If you love someone set them free.\"\n\nMy good friend and yoga pupil Sting, no last initial, told me that.\n\nI can't wait to show you guys all the cool sites in Jacksonville.\n\n\n\nLike, that swamp is where me, Pillboi, and Donkey Doug used to stand and try and blind pilots with laser pointers, and...\n\nMaybe we should do the tour after we, you know, save your father's soul.\n\nOh, I've been meaning to ask.\n\nWhy are you trying to save your father?\n\nI've heard you mention your friend Pillboi many times, but you've not mentioned your father once.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nI talk about Donkey Doug all the time.\n\nI'm sorry. The man you call Donkey Doug is your father?\n\nYeah.\n\nThe Donkey Doug with whom you tried to blind airline pilots with laser pointers?\n\n- Yeah.\n- The Donkey Doug who's banned from Disney World for biting Buzz Lightyear?\n\nIn his defense, he thought it was someone else.\n\nWho?\n\nSo Michael and I have a plan to save my dad.\n\nMy whole life, Donkey Doug was always getting in trouble because of some get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nHe sold counterfeit truck nuts.\n\nHe created a sport that was a cross between dodgeball and horseshoes and everybody died.\n\n- He glued...\n- This should be easy.\n\nWe have plenty of money.\n\nIf we just give him money, he'll blow it.\n\nHe's gotta feel like he did it himself.\n\nA few years ago, Donkey Doug was very close to getting his electrician's license.\n\nSo if we get him to finish the training, he can earn an honest living and be on his way to getting more Good Place points, which is why we're all here.\n\nOkay, let's go save my dad.\n\n- Taxi!\n- [whistle blows]\n\n[rock music blaring]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n- Ha!\n- Need help with your bags?\n\nNah, I got it.\n\n[knock at door]\n\n- Oh, damn, Jason!\n- Oh, dude, Donkey Doug!\n\nYou call him Donkey Doug in person?\n\nMe and Jason are cool like that.\n\nI don't think of him as my son.\n\nI think of him as my boy!\n\nI mean, I\xa0am\xa0your boy.\n\nYeah, but it's more like, \"That's my son right there, son.\"\n\nBut not like, \"Son, son.\"\n\nBut like, \"My boy.\" But not like...\n\nYes, yes, we get it. Thank you.\n\nOh, this is my friend Michael.\n\nOh, crap. You look like a cop.\n\nAre you a cop? Because if you are, you have to tell me, and you're not allowed to arrest me for anything you saw before I knew you were a cop.\n\n- I-I'm not a police officer.\n- Yeah, Michael's cool.\n\nAnd this is Tahani, who is my wife, I guess.\n\nDang, nice pull, son!\n\nHow about you and me go check out my Jacuzzi and put stuff in each other?\n\nAgain, I'm his wife.\n\nWow, that's the first time that line has ever failed.\n\nYou must really love him.\n\nWelcome to the family! Come on in!\n\nThis program knows everything about your personality, Simone's personality, and all human relationships.\n\nIt can't tell you exactly what will happen, but it will approximate Simone's reaction to anything you say to her.\n\nPlus, it has Tetris. [laughs]\n\nHmm, would this work with, say, me and, say, Jason Statham and instead of a caf\xe9, it was, say, a room with a futon and a bunch of Red Bull?\n\nWhy is it that every time a new thing is invented, humans immediately try to use it for porn?\n\n- Because we're disgusting.\n- Huh.\n\nEleanor and I will be watching on the monitor.\n\nWe'll see what you see.\nPut these in your ears.\n\nThey'll play a tone that will trick your brain into seeing what I've programmed.\n\n[electronic beeping]\n\nAh...\n\nWow, so this is...\n\n- I'm here.\n- Hey, babe.\n\nWhat did you want to talk about?\n\nGo ahead, Chidi, practice what you want to say to her.\n\nRight. Um...\n\nSimone, this has been the best year of my life because of you.\n\nUnfortunately, I have come to learn some information, and it means that we have to end this relationship.\n\n- What information?\n- I...\n\n- can't say.\n- Why not?\n\nI-I can't say.\n\nWell, you've either gone crazy, or you're too much of a coward to tell me how you feel.\n\n- Which is it?\n- I-I can't because of...\n\n- [sighs] Janet!\n- Who's Janet?\n\nAnd why are you screaming her name into the sky?\n\nYou know what? Whatever.\n\n- Good-bye, Chidi.\n- No. No. No. Wait...\n\n[groans] So...\n\n- that didn't go great.\n- I disagree.\n\nI thought it was hilarious.\n\nSo, Donkey Doug, Jason told us about your electrician license, and we have a career opportunity for you.\n\nYo, later for that.\n\nI got a business proposition for you.\n\nPillboi!\n\n- Oh, dip! Jason!\n- Oh, dip! Pillboi!\n\n- Oh, dip! Pillboi!\n- Oh, dip! Donkey Doug!\n\n- Oh, dip! Jason!\n- This is remarkable.\n\n- It explains so much.\n- Oh, dip! Pillboi!\n\nJason, I thought you were dead.\n\nBut I was alive. I was in Australia.\n\nI talked to you on the phone last week.\n\n- Yeah, but I forgot.\n- Oh.\n\nMe and Pillboi have been cooking up something real special.\n\nAnd this time, it's not fake meth.\n\nAll right, Pillboi, tell him about our new product.\n\nSharks, how much do you spend on energy drinks and body spray in one week?\n\nThree hundred dollars?\n\nTen hundred dollars?\n\nWhat if I told you there was a product that combined these two things for one solution to all of life's problems and more?\n\nI give to you Double Trouble!\n\nThe world's first energy drink/body spray.\n\nSo do you spray it on yourself, or do you drink it?\n\n- You both it.\n- This is the one, Jason.\n\nWe're gonna be so rich.\n\nI'll finally be able to pay to have my calf implants moved back up from my feet.\n\nThis is gonna be a lot tougher than we thought.\n\nTell me about it.\n\nDouble Trouble sounds amazing.\nWe should bid fast.\n\nThe other sharks are gonna want in.\n\nSo I just have to be simple, honest, and declarative\n\nand somehow still protect her feelings.\n\nI don't know, man.\n\nMaybe just tell her that you're gay.\n\n- I'm not gay.\n- Fine, bi.\n\n- I'm not bi either.\n- Why not?\n\nMore guys should be bi. It's .\n\nIt's like, get over yourselves.\n\nIs there any way I can try a bunch of different things in a row to see what works?\n- Bing.\n\nSure, if you want to reset, just snap your fingers.\n\nAlso, I made some modifications to the tone, so it should make your transition easier.\n\nOh.\n\n[easy listening music playing]\n\nMm!\n\nHey, babe.\n\nWhat did you want to talk about?\n\nWell, I don't love you anymore.\n\n- What?\n- No, no. You don't understand.\n\nI don't technically love you in the same way because of circumstances.\n\nWhat?\n\nHang on. [snaps fingers]\n\n[sighs] I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm dying.\n\n- No, you're not.\n- Yes, I am.\n\nBecause we're all dying slowly, when you think about it.\n\nWe start dying the moment we're born.\n\nSo not a lie.\n\n[snaps fingers] Okay, here it is.\n\nI'm just gonna be perfectly honest.\n\nMy real name is Special Agent Rick Justice, FBI.\n\nNope. [snapping fingers]\n\nSimone... the last year has been truly amazing, and with that in mind...\n\n- Will you marry me?\n- Yes! Yes!\n\nOf course I will! Oh!\n\n[applause]\n\nWait, what am I doing?\n\nWhy did I think this would work?\n\nChidi, I'm gonna go ahead and reboot this one myself.\n\nYeah, good call.\n\n- So, Simone...\n- Wait.\n\nBefore you say anything, I think we should break up.\n- You do?\n\nYes, I love and respect you very much, but we're heading in different directions.\n\nAnd don't worry, we don't have to make a big thing of it.\n\nOh, my God. Okay. This is the one.\n\nRemember everything.\nRight leg crossed over left.\n\nCoffee's right there.\n\nOh, one more thing. Suck it, you doink.\n\n- Sorry?\n- [laughs]\n\nThis is Eleanor, you idiot.\n\nJanet let me mess with the simulator to screw with you.\n\n- Janet, come on!\n- Hi, Chidi.\n\nThis is Janet now.\nSorry, it won't happen again.\n\n- Thank you.\n- Psych! It's still Eleanor!\n\nI can't believe you fell for that, you doink.\n\n- [laughs]\n- [snaps fingers]\n\nWe need to break up, but here's a puppy.\n\nAw! Wait, what?\n\nHe's a puppy, it's over between us, and he's cute.\n\nDo you think I don't hear the bad parts of these sentences?\n- His name is Martin, I need my keys back, and he's a puppy.\n\nYou are very bad at this.\n\nThat's because I don't actually want to break up with her.\n- What, do you need me to break up with her for you like we're in middle school or something?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, please.\n\n- Do that for me. Please.\n- Fine.\n\n[easy listening music playing]\n\nHey, Eleanor.\n\nHey.\n\nWhat did you want to talk about?\n\nWell, first of all, you and Chidi are so great together.\n\nHe really loves you, and I can see why.\n\nYou know, you're brilliant, charming, obviously gorgeous.\n\n- Aw, you're sweet to say that.\n- And your accent is so cute.\n\nYour accent is so cute.\n\nWhat? I don't think I have an accent.\n\n[mimicking Eleanor]\nI don't think I have an accent.\n\nStop it!\n\n[both laughing]\n\n[sighs]\n\nWhat is happening?\n\n[laughs]\n\nNo! No. This is over.\n\nWhoa, man, come on.\nIt was just getting good.\n\nLet's remember the mission.\n\nYour father needs to focus on long-term stability.\n\nAlso, and perhaps this is less important, but there's an awful lot of dog hair on the furniture, and I have not seen a dog.\n\nNot bad, right?\n\nDouble Trouble comes in three delicious smell-flavors: Raspberry Perspirant, Cedarwood Melon Blast, and -Hour Lemon Musk Xtreme.\n\nThat one is also a lube.\n\nLook, Donkey Doug, Double Trouble is dope.\n\nOn that much, we can all agree on.\n\nBut you got to think long-term.\n\nYou were good at electricity stuff.\n\nYou hooked us up with free porno channels every year ever since the third grade.\n\nIt's good, honest work.\n\nHonest work? Whatever, Dad.\n\nYou're his dad.\n\nThis is huge, J.\n\nWhen Double Trouble pops off, I'll be able to quit my job\n\nat the old folks' home.\n\nBuy a big-ass mansion.\n\nEvery day, I'll wake up, get out of bed, brush my teeth, rinse, go downstairs, open the fridge, \"Damn, we out of milk,\" get in my car...\n\nYou don't have to run through the whole imaginary day.\n\nJason, I believe in Double Trouble.\n\nWhy won't you believe in me?\n\nWell, I suppose a little entrepreneurial spirit never hurt anyone.\n\nYou know, reach for the stars, as I said to my good friend\n\nElon Musk.\n\nAnd then he shot his car into space.\n\nWhat a weird creep.\nWhy was I friends with him?\n\nMaybe this is what'll put your father on the right path.\n\nAnd, hey, it's not like he's robbing a bank.\n\nYeah, it's a factory.\n\n- Excuse me?\n- Tonight we're gonna steal some energy drinks from an energy drink factory, then still some cologne from a cologne factory.\n\nSo it's actually two factories.\n\nThen we just got to bottle it all up.\n\nAh, dip, we gotta rob a bottle factory.\n\n- Three factories.\n- Three factories.\n\nStupid Donkey Doug.\n\nI mean, two factories I can understand, but... but three?\n\nYou... you might want to consider the possibility that your father's a lost cause.\n\nI have an idea, but I need your help.\n\nWill you guys help me?\n\nI mean, yeah, that... that's why we're here, Jason.\n\nWhat's your idea, darling?\n\nWe're gonna save Pillboi.\n\n[Chidi] Okay, real life.\nI think I'm ready.\n\nI've analyzed the ten most successful scenarios and compiled the statistically most effective breakup strategy.\n\nWho said you weren't a romantic?\n\nEvery girlfriend I've ever had.\n\nOoh, there she is. Okay.\n\nWish me luck.\n\n\n\n[exhales forcefully]\n\n- Oh, hi. Uh...\n- Is something wrong?\n\nNo, it's just that we're usually over there.\n\nDoesn't matter.\n\nOkay, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything that's happened in the last year...\n\nHi there, what can I get you to drink?\n\nI'll have an iced tea, please.\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Water, thanks.\n\nIt's been a time of massive personal and professional growth...\n\nSorry, sugar with that iced tea?\n\n- Yes, please.\n- Right.\n\nAll in all, it's been overwhelmingly positive, and I think that's due in large part to you...\n\nSorry, real quick, I'm gonna go on break, so Helmut will be taking care of you.\n\nHello.\n\nWill you be eating with us today?\n\nJust please give us one second.\n\nYeah, okay. One.\n\nThat was one second.\n[laughs] That was a joke.\n\nPlease get out of here, Helmut!\n\n- Okay, yeah.\n- All right, look, just...\n\nwe need to break up.\n\nI am... I am breaking up with you.\n\n- Why?\n- I can't... it's... it's complicated, but it's happening.\n\nYa dumped.\n\n- Okay.\n- Wait. Wait, no.\n\nCome back, please.\n\n- Yeah, okay! I'm back.\n- Not you, Helmut.\n\nHey, now, listen, Judy, you can't mix xannys with these little pink fools.\n\nYou'll be tripping balls like Clarence was when he crawled into the ice machine.\n\n- [laughs]\n- Here.\n\nTake half of one of these, wash it down with a -Hour ENERGY, and you'll be golden.\n\nBody high with mild visuals.\n\n[laughs] Thanks, Pillboi.\n\nYo, I gotta take off 'cause I gotta go do a robbery.\n\nI mean... I'm sick.\n\nHello, Pillboi.\n\nI'm here on behalf of Jason.\n\nYou won't be attending the job with Donkey Doug today.\n\nThere's been a change of plans.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's it?\n\nYou don't need any more information?\n\nI mean, do you want to tell me?\n\n- Not really.\n- Cool.\n\nWant some pills?\n\nI hate this. What if I ruined her?\n\nWhat if I sent her down the wrong path and she ends up in the Bad Place?\n\nI have to undo what I did. Janet, fire up the simulator.\n\nDude, no more simulations.\n\nJust talk to her.\n\nBreakups never end with both people feeling great.\n\nBut she's a badass, and her world is bigger than your relationship.\n\nShe'll recover.\n\nJust go.\n\nBe a person.\n\nRight.\n\nHere I go.\n\nJanet, can I use the simulator?\n\nThere's a very specific Lenny Kravitz concert I want to be front row at.\n- Sure.\n\nFYI, when the system boots up, you might find yourself in a steam room with Jason, who will be wearing an old-timey strongman onesie.\n\nIt's a bug in the system.\n\nPillboi?\n\nNo, it's me, Pillboi's friend Jason.\n\nPillboi's not coming.\n\nIf you're here to tell me an energy drink body spray is a bad idea, I've heard it before from a bank and some doctors.\n\nI'ma help you make Double Trouble, but you got to leave Pillboi alone from now on.\n\nI'm trying to save him.\n\nOh, dip. You got religious and shiz?\n\n- Amen.\n- Amen.\n\nOkay, hurry up and get this crap in my truck.\n\n[siren wailing]\n\nJacksonville Police!\n\nCome out with your hands up!\n\nAre you a cop?

You run out the back.\n\nNo, that's crazy.\n\nIt's what my dad did for me and his dad for him.\n\nAnd someday, you'll do this exact thing for your son.\n\nI mean, I hope not, but thanks, Donkey Doug.\n\nHey...\n\n- call me Donkey Dad.\n- Okay.\n\nDonkey Dad.\n\nNah, that sounds wack.\nCall me Donkey Doug.\n\nCool.\n\nBortles!\n\nUh...\n\nHere's the truth. You're amazing.\n\nAnd my feelings have changed.\n\nI wish I could tell you why.\n\nI really, really do, but...\n\nI can't.\n\nWell...\n\nyou seem to know what you want, which is rare for you.\n\nWell, I hope you keep the study going.\n\nMight help a lot of people.\n\n[sighs]\n\nWell...see you in the next life.\n\nWhat? Why would you say that?\nWhat do you know?\n\nIt's a figure of speech.\n\nYou're so weird, man.\n\nI think maybe this is for the best.\n\nSo your covert mission is to continue to report to this job until you receive our signal.\n\nNow, this is the most important thing.\n\nYou cannot commit any more crimes, and you must help these people\n\nas much as you can.\n\n- The mission depends on it.\n- Roger that.\n\nMan, I can't believe this whole time, you guys were with NASA.\n\nYes, we are secret astronaut spies.\n\nThat is indeed what Jason told you.\n\nTake good care of these old fools, and stay out of trouble.\n\nI love you, bro.

What's up?\n\nHow old are you... three?\n\n- I'm nine.\n- Cool.\n\nI don't know anything about kids.\n\nHey, has Diana ever made you hide, like, a special treasure in any of your toys?\n\nNo, Diana's very nice to me.\n\nShe bought me most of these stuffed animals.\n\n[gasps] Oh, wow. Neat.\n\nMind if I give them just a little surgery just to check?\n\nOkay, okay, okay, all right, Doc McStuffins, let's get you some fresh air.\n\nSo sorry.\n\nShe's a kid.\nYou can't disembowel her toys.\n\nFine. New plan.\n\nYou casually mention that you're rich and seduce Donna.\n\nWhen she goes for you, it will prove that this whole thing is a sham.\n\nFirst things first, do you have a p*nis?\n\nI will not seduce Donna.\n\nFor one thing, I could never do that to my pal, Dave.\n\nIt goes against the architect's code.\n\nAlso, your mother seems happy here.\n\nThe Donna I know wouldn't be caught dead in this suburban boredom factory.\n\nShe's scamming them.\n\nLook, believe me, don't believe me...\n\nI don't care. I'm gonna prove it.\n\nYoung lady, you will stop this nonsense.\n\nGo to the PTA meeting and support your mother.\n\nI won't hear another word about it.\n\nWhat the hell was that?\n\nWell, I was going for the \"stern but, you know, caring dad\" vibe.\n\nNo? Didn't work?\n\nNo, not even close... like, not in the ballpark.\n\nI was trying something, Eleanor.\nGive me a break.\n\nUntil Kamilah accepts my apology this open wound will hinder any progress she might make toward getting into the Good Place.\n\nAlso, I'm going to strangle her, which will hinder any air from getting into her lungs.\n\n- Can I talk to her?\n- [sighs]\n\nMaybe we should try a little third-party mediation.\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\nUh, hi.\n\nI'm Tahani's friend, Chidi.\n\nChidi is an Igbo word that means \"God exists.\"\n\nThat's right\n\nSorry, I don't know the etymology of your name, but...\n\nAll of your fears are now mine.\n\n[mystical music]\n\n- What did she say?\n- What?\n\nI don't know. Sorry.\n\nI got distracted. She's amazing.\n\nAll of my fears are hers now.\n\nOf course they are.\n\nUm...\n\nI sincerely apologize to you because I have matured into a fully formed adult with empathy and self-awareness.\n\nBut if you don't accept my apology, I will smash your stupid art exhibit into bits.\n\nMore Tahani theatrics with zero follow-through?\n\nYou don't have it in you to do anything that bold, because I'm the one who got the boldness gene and the good-eyebrow gene.\n\n[gasps, shouts]\n\nOh! Oh, no. All my fears are mine again.\n\nHey, Davey, can you believe the design of this room?\n\nAuditorium? More like Audi-bore-me-um.\n\n[laughter]\n\nSavage.\n\nHello, I'm Diana Tremaine.\n\nI never thought I'd run for PTA board.\n\nFor most of my life, I preferred to crawl... pub crawl.\n\n[laughter]\n\nBut now I want to make sure kids in this decommissioned-military- bombing-test-site- turned-suburban-township get the best education Nevada has to offer.\n\n[scoffs] What's that... always double down on ?\n\nAlso, there is a pretty great kid who goes to this school, and I want to make this place great for her.\n\n- Stand up, sweetheart.\n- [applause]\n\nWell, it was the first Hooters ever made out of brick, sort of inspired by Monticello.\n\n- Hey, mark.\n- Oh, no, it's Dave.\n\nOh, I know your name.\nI'm calling you a mark.\n\nEasy.\n\nI got news for you, dad-bod.\n\nThe woman you know as Diana Tremaine is really\n\nDonna Shellstrop, my much older mother.\n\nShe faked her death and changed her name.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, but that's the deal.\n\nI already knew all that, Eleanor.\n\nYour mother told me everything the first night we met.\n\nThe first night?\n\nWell, no, not the first night, actually.\n\nThat was mostly sex. [chuckles]\n\nYour mother is a very confident and selfish lover.\n\n- Yikes.\n- No, no, no, it's perfect for me\n\n'cause I don't know what I want.\n\nBut anyway, the next morning she told me everything.\n\nAnd we're gonna tell Patricia once she's a little bit older.\n\nFor now, everything is going great.\n\nNo, dude, you don't know my mom.\n\nShe used to put, like, things in a shopping cart, then go to the \" items or less\" aisle, scream \"rat,\" and run out the door without paying.\n\nShe is a liar.\n\nWell, listen, she has been nothing but honest with me.\n\nAnd I like that she's got a wild streak.\n\nIt kind of gets my motor running.\n\nTell you the truth... she's turning me into a bit of a bad boy.\n\nI mean, who am I... Avril Lavigne?\n\n[men laugh]\n\n[mysterious music]\n\nOh, I get it.\n\nComing clean was all part of the scam.\n\nIt's brilliant because he thinks she's honest.\n\nSo, when she runs off with all his money, he'll never see it coming.\n\nCome on, Eleanor.\n\nI changed, you changed, maybe she changed, too.\n\nNo, no way.\n\nWhy can't you accept that she might be living a good, honest life?\n\nThat she's an attentive partner and a good mom?\n\nBecause I wanted that mom.\n\nI wanted the mom who made me afternoon snacks instead of just telling me to look for loose fries in the McDonald's ball pit.\n\nWhy does Patricia get that mom?\n\nIf Donna Shellstrop has truly changed, then that means she was always capable of change, but I just wasn't worth changing for.\n\nI know as your self-appointed father figure, I'm supposed to say something comforting here, but I'm... I'm kind of stumped.\n\n\n\nOkay, final tally... votes for Diana Tremaine, votes for Eileen Capshaw, and one vote for Bofa Deeznutz.\n\nGod, don't look at me like that.\n\nYou're not my real dad.\n\nCongratulations, Madam Secretary.\n\nIt's so crazy, right?\n\nI'm gonna need to get a calculator and maybe a globe.\n\nI don't really understand the job.\n\nListen, um, I'm sorry that I didn't think this whole thing was real.\n\nI just never thought I'd see the day when you made a commitment to... anything.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThank you, baby. That means a lot.\n\n\n\n- Let me help you.\n- No, no, no, not that one!\n\nNot that one! No, sorry, sorry.\n\nThis powder is only for my delicates.\n\nYou don't wash your bras.\n\nNo. No.\n\n[gasps] I knew it.\n\nMy mother is a con artist.\n\nGot ya.\n\nSo, before I'm tortured in the afterlife, I get to spend the rest of this life in a Hungarian prison for destruction of art.\n\nThat's fun.\n\nDestruction of extremely derivative art.\n\nKamilah's work has been mediocre for years.\n\nMother and Father are probably rolling over in their cryogenic chambers.\n\nReally? You don't think they would be proud of her for having a whole museum wing dedicated to her work?\n\n\n\nMy parents' standards were incredibly high, and they were impossible to please.\n\n\n\nPlus, they always pitted my sister and me against each other.\n\nThe two of them were a unit, and Kamilah and I...\n\n[epiphanic music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nGirls, we have a new challenge for you.\n\nEach of you has four hours to complete a rendering of your favorite moment in French military history.\n\nThe winning painting shall be hung in our foyer during our party honoring Fran\xe7ois Mitterrand.\n\nThe losing painting shall provide the kindling for the fire that rages in our hearth during that party.\n\n[laughs] Doesn't that sound wonderful?\n\nYes, Mother, it does.\n\nThank you for this opportunity.\n\nWho will be the winning artist, and who will fail?\n\nLet's find out.\n\n[serious music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nThese paintings...they're us.\n\nYou're the boobs?\n\nSorry.

You're happy here.\n\nBut you need to commit to this... which means getting rid of that stash of escape money.\n\nAnd I think you know what you have to do with it.\n\nSend it to Gene Simmons?\n\nWhat? No.\n\nSpend it on Patricia.\n\nSet up a college fund, buy her a crib... or a car.\n\nI truly don't know anything about kids, but this is your chance to break the chain of Shellstrop mother-daughter crappiness.\n\nYou have a do-over.\n\nUse it.\n\nOh, baby.\n\nIt seems like you've turned into a really good person, and you clearly didn't get that from me, so props to whoever helped you.\n\nIs there more cash in your bra?\n\nAlways. It's why I don't wash them.\n\nI still can't believe that police officer pulled you over just to tell you that you were driving perfectly.\n\nWhy not?

Um... you remember how I told you that you knew everything important about your life?\n\nWell, I-I wasn't thinking about your afterlife life.\n\n\n\nIn one of the reboots, you and Chidi fell in love...deeply, and you told him that you loved him, and he told you that he loved you back.\n\nWe did what, now?\n\nYou want to listen to a podcast maybe?\n    ]"},{number:7,title:"The Worst Possible Use of Free Will",summary:"Eleanor Shellstrop arrives in the Good Place and meets her soulmate Chidi...",transcript:"[This library's depressing.\n\nAll they have in the Poetry section is Jeff Foxworthy books.\n\nWell, we needed someplace deserted, and there's no place more deserted than a public library in Arizona.\n\nNow let's go, man.\n\nWe only have a few hours before we have to pick the g*ng up from the airport.\n\nFire up Janet's memory gizmo.\n\nFlooding your brain with memories from the afterlife is dangerous.\n\nIn one of the reboots, you and Chidi were in love.\n\nCan't you just take my word for that?\n\nNo, dude, I can't.\n\nMy screwed-up relationship with my parents made me believe I could never really love anyone.\n\nI need to see it for myself.\n\nThose are my memories.

We don't know.\n\nMaybe there's a mega-demon who built a t*rture chamber for demons, and this whole thing is just him torturing you.\n\nAnd maybe all the mega-demons are just fulfilling a destiny laid out by a bunch of super intelligent tarantula-squids, who are torturing them, be...\n\n[GASPS]\n\n[ICE CLATTERING]\n\nWhy did you do that?\n\n- Because I have free will.\n- [SIGHS]\n\nAnd because you're being so annoying.\n\nUh.

Who even cares?\n\nI do.\n\nBecause if everything is determined, and we have no free will, then all the stuff we're doing to put more good into the world is pointless.\n\nAnd I want to believe that it matters.\n\nSo if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna use my free will right now to go pick up our friends at the airport.\n\nWorst possible use of free will, but I'm gonna do it anyway, because I care about them.\n\n[MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC]\n\n[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BUILDS]\n\nYou might wanna head out too.\n\nWe're closing soon, and the second we do, they use this place to sh**t porn.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nFirst class was amazing.\n\nThey give you so many free presents.\n\nA shaving kit, an eye mask... oh, a vest.\n\n[AIR HISSING]\n\nAt times like this, it's fun to remember that we're legally married.\n\n[LAUGHS] That is fun.\n\nOh, I call window seat!\n\n[TENDER PIANO MUSIC]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n[DOORS SHUTTING ECHOES]\n\nI'm sorry.

I saw it.\n\nWell, it was a Chidi, sure, but it wasn't me Chidi.\n\nThis is a classic philosophical question.\n\nThe concept of the self, or who we are.\n\nPhilosophically speaking, there's the Chidi I am, who lived a certain life, and there's the Chidi you saw...\n\nyour soul mate or whatever, who had some entirely different life.\n\n- They're not the same Chidis.\n- [scoffs]\n\nI'm so sorry. Yeah, no, I get it.\n\nCounterpoint... that's the dumbest thing you've ever said, and you do not deserve a puppy!\n\nI'm un-blooping your puppy!\n\n-\xa0[soft beep]\n- [grunts]\n\n- [puppies barking]\n- Things are getting cuter, and I want them to get less cute!\n\n[bright music]\n\nSo this is the main feed.\n\nEvery action by every human on Earth is recorded and then sent here to be assigned a point value based on the absolute moral worth of that action.\n\nFor example, a couple in Osaka, Japan, just decided to have a destination wedding.\n\nNegative , points.\n\nOh, and it's a destination theme wedding.\n\nNegative , .\n\nThe theme's \"Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nThey're basically doomed.\n\nAh, here's one.\n\nThis means that someone has just done something which has never been done before.\n\n\"Richard Moore of Sugarland, Texas, \"hollowed out an eggplant and filled it with hot sauce and nickels.\"\n\nAnd amazingly, it's not a weird sex thing.\n\n% of all new human behaviors are weird sex things.\n\nBut not in this... oh, no, it is a weird sex thing, yeah.\n\nWell, then we zip that over to the relevant departments.\n\n\n\nIn this case, Anastasia in the Stuffed Vegetable Department.\n\nWe've got Hector over in American Coins, and my dear buddy, Matt, in Weird Sex Things.\n\nI'm still waiting on a response to the request I filed for immediate su1c1de.\n\nRequest denied.\n\nI love Matty. He's hilarious.\n\nSo they now examine the action... its use of resources, the intentions behind it, its effects on others.\n\nCorrect. And you end up with this.\n\nAnd here is why tampering is impossible... because this score is then double-checked by billion other accountants, all chosen at random, and if they all come to the same conclusion, which they always do, it makes this official.\n\nAnyone who does this same action in the exact same way loses this many points.\n\nWhen people die, their biographical history and final point totals are sent to the relevant destination.\n\nThis batch is going to the Bad Place.\n\nThank you, Doris.\n\n[whooshing]\n\nThe system is flawless, and tampering is quite impossible.\n\nI see. Could we look at one specific file, though, just to make sure?\n\nOh, who do you want to see...\n\nGenghis Khan, Marie Antoinette?\n\nWalt Disney's got some freaky stuff in his file.\n\nDoug Forcett.\n\nI don't get this, man.\n\nWhy wouldn't you want to know what our life was like?\n\nYou're not even a little bit curious what it was like to hit this?\n\nI don't mean\xa0this\xa0this.\n\nAlthough, frankly, I would also hit\xa0this\xa0this.\n\nI don't want to see those memories because, philosophically speaking, they're none of my business.\n\nThey happened to someone else.\n\nLet me explain.\n\n-\xa0[soft beep]\n- Take a seat.\n\nConceptions of the self.\n\nLet's start with John Locke, who believed that personal identity was based on having a continued consciousness... essentially, memory.\n\nMemories are links in a chain that together form a single self.\n\n\n\nIf I can't remember what happened because it happened to a Chidi from another timeline, it's not a unified me.\n\nJust because you don't remember doing something doesn't mean you didn't do it.\n\nI have no idea how it happened, but there is definitely a tattoo on my butt that says \"Jasom.\"\n\nThat leads us to Derek Parfit.\n\n- It does?\n- Parfit said\n\neven if I have memories from an earlier time, that doesn't necessarily mean it was me.\n\nAfter all, if my brain was split in two and each half was put in a different person, which one is me?\n\nAll I know is that other Chidi doesn't exist anymore, and this one does.\n\nSo this must be the real Chidi.\n\nAnd all I know is that you're just barfing Wikipedia all over everyone to avoid talking about your feelings.\n\nLet's talk about David Hume.\n\n[Neil humming]\n\nHere we go, the Book of Dougs.\n\nLet's have a look.\n\nDoug Forbush, Doug Forcap...\n\nDoug L. Forcett.\n\nHey, no peeking. Accountants only.\n\nCan you just tell me his total so far?\n\nLooks like he's at , points.\n\n- Well done, Doug.\n- So that's... that's good?\n\nOh, it's excellent.\n\nWait, he's years old?\n\nOh, that's terrible. He's screwed.\n\nI knew it!\n\nDoug has spent his entire life being nothing but good.\n\nHe once found a dollar on the ground, and he sent it to the Canadian government to help pay down their national debt.\n\nAnd he isn't even close to getting in?\n\nHow can that be?\n\nLook, mate, the points are indisputable.\n\nThey have been since the beginning.\n\n\"Og Gives His Rock to Grog.\"\n\nFirst ever act of human altruism.\n\nOg earned , points that day.\n\nOf course, then Grog used that rock to beat Og's brains in and lost a million points.\n\nThe point is, the math is cold, objective, and airtight, and unless you can prove otherwise,\n\nI don't know how I can help you.\n\nI just got new Weird Sex Thing files in the last one second.\n\nOh, yeah, Burning Man just started.\n\nBuckle up, Matty.\nIt's going to be a long week.\n\n[soft music]\n\nSo, in essence, Hume thought that we don't truly have a self.\n\nWe're just a bundle of our ever-changing impressions.\n\n\n\nJust admit it, man. You're embarrassed you fell in love with an Arizona trash bag.\n\nEleanor, it's not personal.\n\nSomeone fell in love with you.\n\n- It's just not me.\n-\xa0[soft beep]\n\nI told you not to conjure anything.\n\nSorry, I-I just swapped the living room for a classroom.\n\nNot you, him.\n\n- Jason, what is wrong with you?\n- Sorry, Janet.\n\nI didn't mean to conjure Pillboi.\n\nI was just thinking about how much fun we used to have hanging out in his broken hot tub, and then he showed up,\n\nYeah, I was just chilling, being nothing, and then all of a sudden, I was.\n\n- Oh!\n- [chuckles]\n\nGood-bye, Pillboi.\n\nAw, dip. I'm not again!\n\n-\xa0[soft beep]\n- Oh.\n\nYou need to hurry.\n\nMy molecular essence is fragmenting, and it's giving me the worst headache.\n\nOkay, here's a question.\n\nIf Doug Forcett's not getting in, who is?\n\nLet's look at one more file... someone who... who's gotten into the Good Place this year.\n\nAll right, why don't we look at...\n\nNo one. No one got in.\n\n- No one's gotten in for a year?\n- Correct.\n\nHow about the last three years?\n\nAll right, uh, boo-doo-doo...\n\n[tense music]\n\nUh, no one.\n\nWhen was the last time someone got in?\n\nThe last time someone got enough points to get into the Good Place was...\n\nyears ago.\n\nMichael, um...\n\nYo, homey.\n\nYou and Eleanor were fighting before, and I couldn't help but overhear.\n\nHey, if we hear with our ears, why is it called \"butt overhearing\"?\n\nBro, if you don't like her, you should just tell her.\n\n[sighs] It's not about whether I like Eleanor.\n\nI got into philosophy to try to make sense of a world that almost never makes sense.\n\nAnd that was before I learned that I died and then un-died and then re-died.\n\nI just can't take one more thing.\n\nIt's too much.\n\nI'm going to tell you a story.\n\nBack in Jacksonville, there was this guy in my -person dance crew named Stank Toby.\n\nHang on. It was a -person dance crew.\n\nUm...\n\nOh, dip! What are numbers?\n\nYou're not Jason-Janet.\n\nYou're Eleanor-Janet pretending to be Jason-Janet.\n\nThat is so wrong and so confusing!\n\nWhat was I supposed to do, man?\n\nYou wouldn't talk to me.\n\nThis seemed like the only option.\n\n[high-pitched voice]\nHi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor.\n\nI'm Arizona shrimp horny.\n\nThat's not what I sound like, Jason.\n\n- Get out of here.\n- Oh, dip.\n\n[soft beep]\n\nLook, you know what? Just forget it.\n\nWhat am I even doing?\n\nI'm... I'm chasing a dude who isn't into me.\n\nI'm making myself vulnerable for no reason.\n\nI don't even know who I am anymore!\n\n[soft beep]\n\nUh-oh. This is new.\n\nI'm so annoyed at myself.\n\nGah! Stupid, Eleanor! Stupid!\n\nThis whole thing sucks, you know?\n\nEleanor, you... you're not...\n\nThe one thing I never wanted to do, ever, for any reason, was to follow some guy around like a lame puppy dog!\n\nI mean, look at me.\nI don't need to do that.\n\nI can get any guy I want.\n\n- Eleanor, just hang on.\n- What, dude, what?\n\n- What do you want?\n- What is going on?\n\n-\xa0[soft beep]\n- Okay, well, this is bad.\n\nWhy are you staring at me?\n\nDo I have a zit on my nose or something?\n\nYour sense of self is crumbling, and it's taking the void down with it.\n\nGreat. So I don't feel like myself for two seconds, and it breaks the universe?\n\n\n\nHow come nothing went wrong when Chidi freaked out about his identity for three hours?\n\nBecause freaking out about everything\xa0is\xa0my identity.\n\nNot to brag.\n\nI need you to hold it together.\n\nTry to do something Eleanor-y.\n\nLaugh at someone who falls down, or show up to an event under-dressed and get mad at everyone else somehow.\n\nI'll be right back.\n\n[soft beep]\n\n[loud crash, crumbling]\n\nI know I asked you this before, but...\n\nNo, darling, this is not where the Mac and PC guys live.\n\nWhoa!

Not Harriet Tubman?\n\nNot one single Golden Girl?\n\nThe Bad Place has hacked your system!\n\nNo, it hasn't. How dare you?\n\nFrankly, I'm beginning to resent your tone, sir.\n\nIf you've got a problem, then go to the Good Place and take it up with the Committee.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the break room, because there's cake over there, and if I don't move quickly, Erika will get the last corner piece.\n\nGood day, sir!\n\nNo, no, no. This can't be happening.\n\nNo, he was supposed to tell us what to do.\n\nIf he's not going to fix this, who is?\n\n- You, Michael.\n- [groans softly]\n\nIt has to be you.\n\nWe keep wandering around these different realms expecting someone else to have the answer, but no one ever does.\n\nYou're the guy, Michael.\n\nYou're the only one who can fix whatever's wrong with the afterlife.\n\nBut before we get into that, Eleanor's identity is shattering inside of my void, and I might blow up.\n\nSo I'm going to need you to grab a paper clip and marbleize me, like, yesterday.\n\nWhat's going to happen to the humans?\n\nNo idea, but I can't take them out of my void in the middle of this office.\n\nAnd if we do nothing, everyone's gone-zo.\n\nMarbleize me, get us somewhere safe, and bring me back.\n\nRight, a paper clip!\nI need a paper clip!\n\nHey, Matt. Do you have a paper clip?\n\nWhat are you going to use it for?\n\n- Chidi, I'm scared.\n- I know.\n\nWhat am I supposed to be doing right now?\n\nI don't remember.\n\nI'm having a hard time remembering.\n\nRight.\n\nMemories, you need to remember who you are.\n\nYou're Eleanor Shellstrop from Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nYour favorite meal is shrimp scampi.\n\nYou listed your emergency contact as Britney Spears as a long-shot way of meeting her, and your favorite movie is that clip of John Travolta saying \"Adele Dazeem.\"\n\nYou flew halfway around the world because you wanted to be a better person, and it was very brave.\n\nYou're sharp, and you're strong.\n\nYou make fun of me a lot.\n\nYou once called me a human snooze button. but you also showed up in my classroom when I was drowning in despair and canned chili, and you basically saved my life.\n\nYou have very high self-esteem, and a very low tolerance for men who wear sandals, and your worst nightmare is someone saying something nice about you to your face, but too bad because I need to say it because you deserve it.\n\n- Because... because...\n- Chidi...\n\n[soft music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n[both exhale deeply]\n\n[chuckles]\n\nNice work, bud.\n\nDid you mean everything you said, or did you just say it because the world was ending?\n\nI really want to play this cool, but I'm afraid that I'm going to ruin it\n\nif I try to be sexy.\n\nI already ruined it.\n\nUm, saying the word \"sexy\" is not sexy...\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\n- Wait!\n- Ooh!\n\nI'm okay.\n\n- Are you sure?\n- Yes, I'm okay.\n\n- Wait.

That's like four Oreos.\n\nWe're four Oreos from heaven.\n\nI know.

What a fun thought experiment.\n\n- You said it, Gwendolyn.\n- Uh-huh.\n\nSay, is that a dog barking in another room?\n\nI doubt it, because I don't have a dog.\n\nBut out of politeness and an abundance of caution,\n\nI'll go check.\n\nHello, doggy.\n\nMy name is Michael, I'm an Accountant.\n\nI need to speak with the Committee immediately,\n\non the top floor of the Correspondence Center.\n\nThank you.\n\n[bright music]\n\nJason, you seem thoughtful\n\nand that concerns me.\n\nDo you remember that one time when we were in Janet's void,\n\nand we all looked like Janet?\n\nI do, yes.\n\nYou know how I saw that thing about how Janet loves me?\n\nI don't know how I feel about her,\n\nand also, I feel bad that I sort of,\n\nlike, read her diary.\n\nAnd she doesn't know. What should I do?\n\nWell, perhaps, you should tell Janet what you saw,\n\nand start a dialogue about your feelings.\n\nWho knows if a relationship will take hold,\n\nbut you must begin from a place of honesty.\n\nThanks, Tahani.\n\nIt's nice to know I can talk about girls with my wife.\n\nHey, Janet.\n\nUh, so, do you remember how you k*lled us\n\nand brought us into your void?\n\nI do, yes.\n\nWhen we were in there, I was wandering around,\n\nbecause you have the ability to make anything,\n\nand I wanted to see where you keep the roller blades.\n\nAnd I accidentally saw that video thing\n\nabout how you love me.\n\nYou saw that?\n\nThat's so embarrassing.\n\nI mean, it kind of freaked me out at first.\n\nBut, hey, let's talk about it.\n\nI don't want to talk about this.\n\nYou guys were in my void, and it was exhausting,\n\nand I almost blew up, and I have to be neutral,\n\nand Neutral Janets don't have feelings...\n\nHow's it going in here?\n\nIt is going neutrally. End of conversation.\n\n- Can... can we...\n- End of conversation.\n\nYou got one shot, buddy.\n\nBe clear, be confident,\n\nand don't let them intimidate you.\n\nOh, wow.\n\n- Wow.\n- This is place is very cool.\n\nHave you guys ever been here before?\n\n- I have never been here before.\n- No, no, no.\n\n- I love it, so charming.\n- Really great, it's earthy.\n\nHello, everyone. I'm Michael.\n\nThank you for coming.\n\nNo, thank you for asking us to come.\n\nIt is one of the great honors of my eternal life\n\nto be invited here by you, today,\n\nfor this momentous occasion.\n\nNow, who are you, and why are we here?\n\nWell, in a nutshell, I believe that the Bad Place\n\nhas somehow infiltrated the Accounting Department,\n\nand it's tampering with the points system.\n\nMy goodness, that would be a disaster.\n\nEveryone focus up. Meg, you take notes.\n\nDaisuke, open a secure channel to headquarters.\n\nKellen, head to the farmer's market\n\nand grab us fresh peaches.\n\nI think pluots are in season.\n\nThen get pluots, Kellen.\n\nGet as many pluots as can fit in your tote bag.\n\nWe're gonna be here a while.\n\nBrought you some water.\n\nWell, I mean, there's not a kitchen,\n\nbut I found this kind of glowing bowl\n\nwith liquid in it?\n\nMaybe it was a toilet.\nI'm gonna throw this out.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nTrying to jimmy the lock,\n\nbut everything I stick in here just turns to glitter.\n\n- Ugh.\n- All right, forget about the door.\n\nLook at me. Right now,\n\nwe're together in heaven basically.\n\nAnd we're in love.\n\nCompared to some of the other stuff that's happened to us,\n\nit could be worse.\n\nI guess \"try and enjoy this\" is a better plan than\n\n\"have the anxiety sweats.\"\n\nOh, check it out... straight through my sweatshirt.\n\nCool. Hey.\n\nI have an idea to take your mind off the door.\n\nLet's go on a date.\n\n- What?\n- No, I'm serious.\n\nWhy not have our first date four Oreos away from paradise?\n\nYou still wanna go out with me\n\nafter I just showed you my anxiety sweats?\n\nMan, you must really be into me.\n\nYou have to admit, it's very odd\n\nthat no one has gotten into the Good Place for years.\n\nWell, there've been dips before.\n\nRemember like, , years ago,\n\nwhen they invented stabbing, and they were all just,\n\nlike, stabbing each other?\n\nAgain, I urge you to look at Doug Forcett.\n\nThe man has lived a selfless life,\n\nand he's not even close to getting in.\n\nThe only explanation is that the Bad Place\n\nhas somehow rigged the system.\n\nI wouldn't put it past them.\n\nEvery single Bad Place employee is a disgusting monster.\n\nWell, some of 'em are probably cool, handsome,\n\nman-about-town types.\n\nCommittee, Michael the Accountant has brought us\n\nevidence of a problem, and now it is up to us\n\nto find a solution.\n\nWhile you wait, Kellen will stand by you,\n\nshowering you with compliments.\n\nGreat job, Michael. You are such a good speaker.\n\nThis suit is very flattering. You have a lot of gravitas.\n\nI thought I was gonna be annoyed by this,\n\nbut it's... it's wonderful.\n\nYour jawline is extraordinary.\n\nYou're a nice height. Your energy is electric.\n\nI gotta say, it's been really nice\n\nhaving a little company.\n\nIt's nice to be here.\n\nAnd it's not nice to not be there.\n\nSo, how'd you two meet? Was it through the contest?\n\nTahani and I met in brain school,\n\nand then we got married, because nothing mattered.\n\nYou're both so attractive.\n\nAre all humans as attractive as you two?\n\n[laughs] No.\n\nFantastic.\n\nSay, Jason, can you help me get more wicker baskets\n\n- from the other room?\n- Sure thing.\n\nI'm so sorry, darling, this is all my fault.\n\nI encouraged Jason to come clean\n\nabout what we saw.\n\nYou saw that too?\n\n- No.\n- [groans]\n\nJason knows that I love him, it stinks to hear about\n\nhow the two of you are married,\n\nthis beige outfit really washes out my not-skin,\n\nand if I don't remain neutral in front of Gwendolyn,\n\nshe's gonna know we've been lying.\n\nAll of these new emotions I'm feeling\n\nare about to burst out of me,\n\nwhich might be super embarrassing.\n\nWhat if they come out my butt?\n\n[bright music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nWhoa, champagne.\n\nFound it in the cupboard. I think it was a gift.\n\nI feel kind of bad, what if it was\n\nfor something really important?\n\n\"Gwendolyn: Here's some champagne for you\n\n\"for thanking me for thanking you\n\n\"for thanking me for thanking you\n\nfor thanking me for the champagne you sent me.\"\n\nPop that bench.\n\n[pops]\n\nThis is my kind of scrappy fun,\n\nsneaking around with a boy, trying not to get caught.\n\nI know, it's like when my parents would go\n\nto a symposium and I would sneak into their office\n\nand read the unabridged dictionary.\n\nI can't believe I'm attracted to you.\n\nYou are, though.\n\nI'm not worried about that anymore.\n\nYou blew it when you admitted it to me.\n\nYou still thinking about what's on the other side of that door?\n\nNot really, no.\n\nBecause you're here with me on this side.\n\nI have... one more\n\nlittle surprise for you.\n\nOkay, open 'em.\n\nHoly forking fork.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nOh, no, you're crying.\n\nI assume it's because you're happy or horny.\n\nIs this a horny cry?\n\nNo, I'm crying because I'm miserable,\n\nand it's all your fault.\n\nWhy? Do you not like the outfit?\n\nI love the outfit. You look amazing.\n\nAnd this sucks, and I'm furious,\n\nand I'm the happiest I've ever been,\n\nand I blame you.\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nIn light of this new information,\n\nthe time has come to take decisive action.\n\nWow, can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that.\n\nWe are gonna form an elite investigative team\n\nto get to the bottom of this.\n\nAnd we are fast-tracking the process.\n\nIt'll take no more than years.\n\nSorry?\n\nIt's aggressive, but you heard right.\n\nWe are only giving ourselves years to select\n\nthe members of this elite team.\n\nWait, years just to form the team?\n\nI was thinking that we could do something now-ish.\n\nLike, right now.\n\nMichael, we have rules, procedures.\n\nWe're the good guys. We can't just do stuff.\n\nNo.\n\nUpon formation, the team will then be in charge\n\nof organizing a Blue Ribbon Commission\n\nto investigate themselves,\n\nto make sure there's no conflicts of interest.\n\nAnd that will take , years.\n\nOkay.\n\nJust so you know, the whole time you're doing this,\n\nthe bad guys are continuing to t*rture everyone\n\nwho ends up in the Bad Place, which is everyone.\n\nAnd that deeply concerns us.\n\nHave you seen the memoranda we've sent each other\n\nabout how concerned we are?\n\nWe're taking this very seriously.\n\nHear, hear.\n\nKellan, did you file a \"Hear, Hear\" memorandum?\n\nNo. Sincerest apologies.\n\nI rescind my \"Hear, hear\" and resign,\n\neffective immediately.\n\n[applause]\n\n\n\nHey, you two.\n\nI think I may have solved one part of our little problem.\n\nI made up a \"Death Did Us Part\" certificate,\n\nexplaining that since Jason and I are dead,\n\nwe are officially no longer fake-married.\n\nI know it's not your main concern,\n\nbut whatever part of you was vexed\n\nby our silly arrangement, you can now both relax.\n\nI can tell by your silence\n\nand inability to make eye contact with me\n\nthat I've knocked it out of the park.\n\nIt's a nice gesture.\n\nI feel both pitied and put on the spot,\n\nso... that's fun.\n\nAnd it's a cool reminder of how I'm... dead.\n\nWell, forget it. Never mind.\n\nMisfire.\xa0\xa0Watch\xa0this.\n\nThere, cancelled.\n\nSo, you and I are married again?\n\nNo, we... we're not. Um...\n\nBleh.\n\n- It's okay.\n- [whimpering]\n\nCry as long as you want.\n\nI'm going to. [sniffling]\n\n'Cause my tears taste like the nacho cheese\n\nfrom my favorite movie theater.\n\nThat's a really weird incentive to keep crying.\n\nRelationships are stupid.\n\nYou're scared you're never gonna have a real one,\n\nand then when you do, you're scared it's gonna go away.\n\nHere's an idea, what if we don't worry\n\nabout whatever comes next?\n\nThere's a quote I like by Tolstoy:\n\n\"There is only one time that is important: Now.\n\n\"It is the only time...\n\nTOGETHER: \"When we have any power.\"\n\nI know that quote.\n\nAn unverified Tyra Banks account posted\n\nthat meme on Instagram.\n\nWell, now I hate it.\n\n[laughs]\n\nThere is another quote first spoken\n\nby a very wise, very attractive,\n\noccasionally very sweaty philosopher:\n\n\"You gotta try.\"\n\nNow, she was talking about making the world a better place,\n\nbut I think it applies\n\nto relationships too.\n\nI've got an idea of something we could try.\n\nGreat. What?\n\nOh.\n\nWait, I... I think I know...\n\nWell, I don't wanna assume.\n\nWhat if we both write down what we think you mean...\n\nWhat if we didn't?\n\nOoh... ah.\n\nMichael? How did it go?\n\nIs the Committee going to help us?\n\nThe Committee's a bunch of ineffectual dorks\n\nin fleece vests.\n\nThe Titanic is sinking, and they're writing\n\na strongly-worded letter to the iceberg.\n\nHow much more evidence do they need?\n\nThe Bad Place has to be tampering with the system.\n\nThere's no other explanation.\n\nCan I ask you an unrelated question?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nThe fate of all of humanity is at stake,\n\nand time is running out.\n\n[somber music]\n\nGo ahead.\n\nI'm trying to help Jason and Janet\n\nnavigate some very complex feelings,\n\nbut everything I do makes it worse.\n\nYou know them better than anyone else.\n\nHow do I just make them happy?\n\nHow do you make Jason happy?\n\nYou give him a lollipop shaped like a Transformer.\n\nYou'd think it'd be that simple.\n\nBut every time I do something nice, it backfires.\n\nThere are so many unintended consequences\n\nto well-intentioned actions.\n\nFeels like a game you can't win.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThere is another explanation:\n\nunintended consequences.\n\nOh, Tahani, you did it.\n\nWell, of course I did, darling.\n\nDid what?\n\nAll along, I've only been looking at one Doug,\n\nbut there's millions of Dougs in here.\n\n[bleeping]\n\nIn , Douglass Wynegar of Hawkhurst, England,\n\ngave his grandmother roses\nfor her birthday.\n\nHe picked them himself, walked them over to her,\n\nshe was happy... boom, points.\n\n- [bleeping]\n- Now...\n\nYeah, here we go.\n\n[bleeping]\n\nIn , Doug Ewing of Scaggsville, Maryland,\n\nalso gave his grandmother a dozen roses,\n\nbut he lost four points.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause he ordered roses using a cell phone\n\nthat was made in a sweatshop.\n\nThe flowers were grown with toxic pesticides,\n\npicked by exploited migrant workers,\n\ndelivered from thousands of miles away,\n\nwhich created a massive carbon footprint,\n\nand his money went to a billionaire r*cist CEO\n\nwho sends his female employees pictures of his genitals.\n\nWhoo!\n\nThat is a very odd thing to cheer.\n\nDon't you understand?\n\nThe Bad Place isn't tampering with points;\n\nthey don't have to.\n\nBecause every day the world\n\ngets a little more complicated,\n\nand being a good person gets a little harder.\n\nGather the others. We have a lot to do.\n\nBut we didn't really deal with my thing...\n\nOkay, I'll just figure it out.\n\nJanet, I owe you an apology.\n\nI'm very sorry I meddled.\n\nTruly, I was only trying to help,\n\nbecause I want you two to be happy.\n\nAnd because, well, I love you.\n\nI really do. I love you both.\n\n- [sniffles]\n- Oh, no.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nDid I say something wrong again?\n\nNo, I'm just crying because\n\nyou're such a nice and thoughtful friend.\n\nAnd the emotions aren't coming out of my butt,\n\nthey're coming out of my eyes,\n\nwhich is somehow just as embarrassing.\n\n- Why are you crying?\n- I don't know.\n\nI'm British, I... I never cry.\n\nBut you're saying these nice things about me,\n\nand it's making me cry.\n\nAnd also, this is less important,\n\nbut the carpeting is really disgusting.\n\n[crying]\n\n[wailing]\n\nWhy are you crying?\n\nI just like being a part of things.\n\n[crying]\n\nTwo humans and a Neutral Janet crying?\n\nIn the Good Place?\n\nI've never been suspicious of anyone,\n\nbut I think that's about to change.\n\nOh, no reason to be suspicious,\n\nI promise you, we've done nothing untoward.\n\nWhat's up, fart-faces?\n\nChidi and I just had sex in a closet.\n\nMichael, have you all been lying\n\nto me this whole time?\n\nThat upsets me!\n\nI'm gonna try to shake my fist at you.\n\nD'oh!

Where'd you come from, little buddy?\n\nNo, don't touch it!\n\nTahani, do not touch the Neednoggle.\n\n- What?\n- Bad.\n\nThis is all bad.\n\n[scoffs] Humans are such whiners.\n\nHere, hot pants, let me take care of it for you.\n\nHelp.\n\nAh.\n\nAh.\n\nEverybody, you're all still standing in the IHOP.\n\nThe Judge simply augmented your reality to make you feel like you're in a normal IHOP.\n\nVery smart.\n\nDon't suck up to me, you suck-up.\n\nThis is far better.\n\nInstead of a slug creature, I have a cute little scarf.\n\n- No! No!\n- No, no, no! Don't touch it!\n\nTahani, that's still the Neednoggle.\n\nThe Judge just made it look like a scarf.\n\n- Wonderful.\n- All right.\n\nWhy don't we all sit down so I can fill the Judge in on what we've learned?\n\nYour Honor, I once stood in front of you and said I thought there was something wrong with the points system.\n\nI finally know what it is.\n\nLife now is so complicated, it's impossible for anyone to be good enough for the Good Place.\n\nI know you don't like to learn too much about life on Earth to remain impartial, but these days just buying a tomato\n\n\n\nat a grocery store means that you are unwittingly supporting toxic pesticides, exploiting labor, contributing to global warming.\n\nHumans think that they're making one choice, but they're actually making dozens of choices they don't even know they're making.\n\nYour big revelation is life is complicated?\n\nThat's not a revelation.\n\nThat's a divorced woman's throw pillow.\n\nI mean, this guy chose this tomato.\n\nThose are the consequences.\n\nYou don't want the consequences?\n\nDo the research. Buy another tomato.\n\nWhat else you got?\n\nUm...\n\nI'll tell you what else I got, uh...\n\nI got this.\n\nMichael.\n\nWhat... what are you doing?\n\nThe Backpack Kid dance.\n\n- Why?\n- I don't know.\n\nIt makes people happy.\n\nIs it helping?\n\nCan I say something?\n\nJean-Paul Sartre once wrote...\n\nBoring!\n\n[grunts] I got this.\n\nI want to tell you about a guy from my dance crew in Jacksonville called Big Noodle.\n\nWell, we gave it our best shot, guys.\n\nIt was nice knowing you.\n\nI used to yell at Big Noodle 'cause he always showed up late to rehearsal.\n\nThen one day, the swamp under my house flooded.\n\nI needed a place to crash, so I slept at Big Noodle's house.\n\nTurns out that he had to juggle three jobs to take care of four grandparents who all lived in the same bed just like in \"Willy Wonka.\"\n\nI never yelled at Big Noodle for being late after that\n\n'cause I knew how hard it was for him to be there.\n\nAnd he definitely didn't have time to research what tomatoes to buy.\n\nEven if he wanted to, possession of a non-fried vegetable is a felony in Jacksonville.\n\nThe point is, you can't judge humans 'cause you don't know what we go through.\n\nAmazingly, Your Honor, he's right.\n\nI didn't really understand people until I went to Earth.\n\nMaybe you should give it a shot.\n\nIf you still don't see things our way, then we'll drop it, and you can...\n\nyou know, zappy, zappy, marble, marble.\n\nYeah, sure. I'll give it a shot.\n\nI'll go down there.\nSee what you guys go through.\n\nAnd then one way or another, this is going to end.\n\nHey, do you guys know a good place where I can get Mexican food?\n\nOh... [scoffs] Mexico.\n\nDuh. [chuckles]\n\n- Whoa.\n- [sighs]\n\nHow long will she be gone?\n\nNo way to tell.\n\nUh, my guess is...\n\nOh, brother.\n\nThat was rough.\n\n- Right?\n- Sheesh.\n\nEarth is a mess, y'all.\n\nWoof!\n\nAlso, I guess I'm black?\n\nAnd they do not like black ladies down there.\n\nCrap, y'all.\n\nThis is bad.\n\nWhere did you go, exactly?\n\nTanzania, Paraguay, Vietnam, Denmark.\n\nIt's terrible everywhere and always in a different way.\n\nThe only place I liked was Hawaii, although I barely left the resort.\n\nThe last place I went was a Black Friday sale at an outlet mall in Michigan.\n\n- Why?\n- For the deals.\n\nEarth stinks, y'all.\n\nIt's hot, and it's crowded... but somehow also cold and lonely.\n\nI thought it was going to be so easy to make good decisions.\n\n\n\nThe first thing I did was I Googled \"big, juicy natural tomatoes,\" which led me to a porn site that was for people with a sunburn fetish or...\n\nI kind of never recovered.\n\nRight. That's problem number one.\n\nLife is chaotic and messy and unpredictable.\n\nProblem number two... even if you do somehow manage to make good decisions, you still lose points because of the unintended consequences.\n\nYeah, there are booby traps everywhere.\n\nLike, there's this chicken sandwich that if you eat it, it means you hate gay people.\n\nAnd it's delicious.\n\nIt is. It is so good.\n\nAnd I essentially tried to do what you suggested.\n\nI obsessed over every choice.\n\nBut that was also bad, and I still got sent to the Bad Place.\n\nSo I'm problem number three.\n\nOh, no, you are nobody's problem, sweetheart.\n\n[sighs]\n\nYou know, we got to figure this out.\n\nAnd then Turtle makes a bet with Ronda Rousey, and if she loses, she has to...\n\nOh, come on.\n\nI was just in the middle of torturing William Shakespeare by describing the plot to the \"Entourage\" movie.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nSome new information has come to my attention, and I need a solution.\n\nI want the Bad Place to weigh in on this.\n\nBut first, let's have a change of scenery.\n\n[all yelp]\n\nRemember, guys, we're still in the IHOP, so be careful.\n\nShawn, I have reason to believe that humans might be, on average, better than the points system suggests they are.\n\nCounterpoint... humans are terrible...\n\nLimp Bizkit, sl*very.\n\nThe prosecution rests.\n\nGot to say, that's a solid rebuttal.\n\nLook, there are plenty of awful people and thoughtless jerks, and, I guess Nazis again, somehow.\n\nBut there are also people who are really trying to be good, and they aren't getting close.\n\nBecause they're not good at being good because they're bad.\n\n\n\nThe score they got on Earth is how good or bad they are... full stop, end of story.\n\nThen why did these four get better over and over again in my Neighborhood?\n\nWhy did they help each other in ways they had never helped anyone on Earth?\n\nI don't know. Maybe it's a fluke.\n\nPlus, you have zero proof they did get better.\n\nYou didn't keep track of their points.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI know what we have to... Aah!\n\nOh. He forgot we're still in the IHOP.\n\nAnybody got eyes on Chidi?\n\n[high-pitched voice] Help!\n\nHelp!\n\nCan someone grab my tiny boyfriend, please?\n\nI'm on it. And... got him.\n\nAh. Here you go.\n\nAh! Ha!\n\n[breathing heavily]\n\nI... I just saw a trillion different realities folding onto each other like thin sheets of metal, forming a single blade.\n\nYeah, yeah, the Time-Knife.\nWe've all seen it.\n\n- Let's get back on track, bud.\n- Oh, okay, sure.\n\nWhat I was saying, um, before, you know...\n\nI saw the Time-Knife?\n\nIs this...\n\nMichael is right.\n\nHis Neighborhood gave us the chance to become better people because it removed all the variables that make life on Earth hard.\n\nYeah, uh, there was no rent to pay, no racism, no sexism.\n\nNo awards-show gift-suite publicist infighting.\n\nWhat? Those gift suites can be a real minefield.\n\nBut Shawn is also right.\n\nThe four of us becoming better people could be a fluke.\n\nSo let's repeat the experiment.\n\nIt's what Simone taught us about data collection.\n\nTry it again and see if you get the same results.\n\nOf course! I build a new Neighborhood.\n\nWe choose four new people, tell them they're in the Good Place, create challenges for them, track their progress.\n\nMy guess is they will do what the original four did.\n\nSeek help, support each other, make wise decisions, improve.\n\nIf they do, then it's proof that humans are not \"bad, full stop, end of story.\"\n\nThis is so stupid.\n\nWhere would you even put this Neighborhood?\n\nI wouldn't allow it to be built in the Good Place, that's for sure.\n\nAnd I doubt you'd want to come back to my neck of the woods.\n- Ooh.\n\nI have an idea.\n\nHi, Mindy. We need to use your backyard.\n\nYou need my backyard? For what?\n\nWe're conducting an important experiment...\n\nOkay, you know what? I don't care.\n\nIn fact, as soon as I started asking the question, I thought to myself, \"Why are you asking this?\n\nYou don't care about the answer.\"\n\nDo whatever you want. Just leave me out of it.\n\nAnd if you want to talk to someone, talk to Derek.\n\nI'm sure he'll be happy to see you.\n\nWho's Derek?\n\nDon't think of Derek as my ex-boyfriend.\n\nI made him, so... he's more like my son.\n\nAlthough I did make him because I was jealous of you and Tahani, so he's kind of my rebound booty call.\n\nSo he's your son-rebound-booty-call.\n\nFine, if you want to put labels on it, I guess he's my son-rebound-booty-call.\n\nBut he doesn't mean anything to me.\n\nAlso, Derek never really...worked right.\n\nHe's a buffoon.\n\nYou have nothing to worry about.\n\n\"How should he love thee?\n\n\"Or how deem thee wise Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering?\"\n\nOh. I didn't see you there.\n\nI was just reciting some Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nHi. I'm Derek.\n\nWelcome to the Medium Place.\n\n[gurgling]\n\nDerek, why are you so different?\n\nYou have Mindy to thank for that.\n\nSee, she found a plunger sticking out of the ground behind our house, and every time she hits it, I pass out.\n\nWhen I come to, I'm a little bit smarter and a little bit better.\n\nNot to brag, but I almost have a full-grown p*nis now.\n\nIt's resplendent and mostly functional.\n\nHow many times has Mindy rebooted you?\n\nI don't know. Half a million.\n\n- What?\n- She reboots me a lot.\n\nSometimes when she's bored or just needs some \"alone time.\"\n\nSometimes just for laughs.\n\n[laughing] Derek.\n\n- Shall we head inside?\n- Okay.\n\nCool.\n\nSo here are the rules.\n\nMichael designs the new Neighborhood however he wants.\n\nThe Bad Place gets to choose the four new humans.\n\nBut they have to be the same general level of badness as the original four, all right?\n\nNo serial K*llers, no dictators, no one who managed a boy band.\n\nMichael will not get the files in advance, so he does not have forever to plan.\n\n\n\nBut he can then change the Neighborhood however he wants.\n\nYeah, I have about a billion objections to this.\n\n- So do I.\n- Good.\n\nThat means it's a fair compromise.\n\nSo one last issue... where do we get all the other residents for this place?\n\nWell, my original Neighborhood was built for t*rture, so everyone was a demon.\n\nWe can't have that.\n\nI say we get them from the Good Place.\n\nOver my dead skin suit.\n\nWell, what other option do we have?\n\nWould anybody like a Medium snack?\n\nI myself will be enjoying another classy martini.\n\nDon't mind if I do.\n\n[gasps]\n\nI can make the people.\n\nJust like I made Derek.\n\n- Are you sure?\n- Yes.\n\nIf the Judge restores my powers in the Medium Place, I can do it.\n\nThey'll be way more advanced than the original Derek.\n\n- No offense.\n- None taken.\n\nOkay, the other residents will be comprised of Janet babies.\n\nYou will have one year of Earth time to try to improve the humans.\n\n\n\nI will be monitoring everything to ensure there's no cheating and to track the humans' progress.\n\nDeal?\n\n- [electric buzzing]\n- [grunting]\n\n- Ow!\n- [chuckling]\n\n- Classic.\n- Ha ha!\n\n\n\n- [electric buzzing]\n- Ow!\n\n- Janet?\n- Hi, there.\n\n- Ah.\n- Ready to start building?\n\n- Yes.\n- I have some ideas for how to design a sort of basic Neighborhood, which we can then tailor to the guests as we learn more about them.\n\nNow, when you say, um, some ideas...\n\n- I have trillion ideas.\n- Yes.\n\nI'm so glad you're here, Janet.\n\n- Me too.\n- All right, so...\n\n[clears throat]\nWhat's your first basic idea?\n\n[beep]\n\nPerfect. So basic.\n\n[both laugh]\n\n[peaceful music]\n\n\u266a \u266a\n\nThis house was built to t*rture you.\n\nWhy did you have Michael re-create it exactly?\n\nWell, in the memories I watched, this was where we fell in love.\n\nSo I figured, why mess with success?\n\nI mean, blegh, what am I saying?\n\nThis house is stupid.\n\nAnd you're lame, and I hate you.\n\nI love you, too.\n\nThis is gonna be fun.\n\nI mean, I know we have to help these new people, but most of the time, we'll just get to live together like a normal couple.\n\nWe can chill out and just relax\n\n- and study philosophy...\n- Have sex.\n\nHorndog.\n\nNerd!\n\n[straining]\n\n[beep]\n\nHi, I'm Daphne.\n\nHi, Daphne, I'm Janet.

Janet doesn't need your help, dude.\n\nActually, it would go a lot faster.\n\n- Thanks, Derek.\n- No problem.\n\n- [beep]\n- Don't worry.\n\nThis is purely professional, okay?\n\nNow, be a pal and hold my classy martini while I get down to business.\n\nLet's make people.\n\n[phone ringing]\n\nHello, Your Honor.\n\n[chuckling] You fell for it.\n\nIt's me, Shawn.\n\nJust wanted to wish you bad luck.\n\nTrying to psyche me out? You must be scared.\n\nOh, I'm very confident.\n\nI think we've picked some excellent subjects\n\nfor your stupid experiment.\n\nWhen you fail, and you will,\n\nI've got something special cooked up\n\nfor your four little friends.\n\nLet me guess, they're gonna be tortured with p*nis-flatteners and bees with teeth.\n\nYou are so predictable.\n\nWhy don't you at least switch it up once in a while?\n\nTry using teeth-flatteners and bees with penises.\n\nFirst of all, that's stupid.\n\nBut also, we are switching it up.\n\nWhen you fail, the four humans\n\nwill be tortured for all eternity.\n\nBut guess who's going to be doing the torturing?\n\nHello, idiot.

I mean, if none of this is real, then it really shouldn't matter, right? In fact...\n\n- Ha. Dude!\n- What?\n\nIt's not real! None of this matters.\n\nLeave that on your nose\n\n- for the rest of time.\n- Fine.\n\nPoint sort of taken.\n\nYou know, in a larger sense, if you go around acting like no one else matters then you end up doing things like knocking over cakes and pushing people into pools and just generally acting like a jerk.\n\nWhy not treat them better just in case they're real?\n\nI mean, what do you have to lose by treating people with kindness and respect?\n\nOkay, keep talking, probably fake, but maybe real, philosopher man.\n\nWell, good news... Simone and Chidi are hitting it off.\n\nI mean, I wasn't getting any use out of him as a boyfriend, so why not pass him off to someone in need?\n\n\n\nIs this what donating old bras to Goodwill feels like?\n\nMust've been really hard lying to Chidi like that.\n\nThat's the thing. I don't know that it was a lie.\n\nThey did fall in love on Earth, and Michael was right.\n\nChidi made a huge sacrifice for us, and I had to make sure it was worth it.\n\nIt's arguable that you made an even bigger sacrifice.\n\nYou actually have to live with this situation.\n\nChidi just gets to go around blissfully unaware of what he gave up.\n\nYeah, but we know what he gave up.\n\nDat

something dumb with your hair.\n\nNumber 42 was watch \"Mamma Mia!\n\nHere We Go Again,\" so I did that, too.\n\nIt was okay.\n\nIt's just a lot of the same songs as the first one.\n\nWell, hopefully, diving back into work was also high on that list because we need to help John and I know how.\n\n- Spa day.\n\n- Spa day?\n\nThat's right, Janet.\n\nI've cracked the code.\n\nSee, in 2014, John wrote eleven articles mocking Gigi Hadid's vacation at an exclusive resort in Bali.\n\nBut then he researched cheap flights to Bali for himself, and looked into something called a discount hotel package?\n\n\n\nSee, John's pettiness was the result of feeling excluded by the rich and powerful.\n\nSo I, the rich and powerful, am going to welcome him into an exclusive world of luxury and pampering!\n\nOh, he loves celebrity gossip.\n\nYou should tell him about how eight different characters from \"Game of Thrones\" are based on you.\n\nThat is a great idea.\n\nSee?\n\nYou're getting it now.\n\nFirst, we open his pores, and then we open his heart.\n\nWe exfoliate the dead skin cells of envy, and we detoxify his soul.\n\nSpa day.\n\nSpa day.\n\nI'm so excited for Spa day.\n\nI mean, I know I can eat whatever I want and not gain weight and the air is obviously perfect and no one has any jobs or stress or problems, but I just feel like I need this.\n\nWell, you are in for a

I will look after Jianyu as if he is my own brother.\n\nWow.\n\nI mean, a promise from a strict Kantian like yourself is just about the most ironclad agreement in the universe.\n\nOkay.\n\n- Bye-bye.\n\n[CHUCKLES.]\n\n- Bye.\n\nSo, Jianyu, would you like some Yo, shut up for a sec.\n\nI'm not a Buddhist monk.\n\nMy name is Jason Mendoza.\n\nI'm a DJ from Florida, and I'm not supposed to be here.\n\nYou gotta help me out, homie.\n\nI'm scared.\n\nTea.\n\nI was gonna offer you some tea.\n\n- - Dude, thanks to you, my dream came true.\n\nI have a shiny new butthole.\n\n- You okay,

Oh.\n\nUh, yes, my apartment was decorated in one way, and now it has been redecorated.\n\n- And how's Jianyu?\n\n- I mean, you know how monks are.\n\nCalm, peaceful, never, you know, shotgunning Cheez Whiz.\n\nI mean, what monk would do that?\n\nNo monk!\n\n[CHUCKLES.]\n\nAnyway I see you guys are still here.\n\nWe were just dropping by to ask a favor.\n\nCan you accompany Jianyu to the luau tonight?\n\nHe still isn't really engaging with the Neighborhood, and we were hoping you could help him break out of his shell.\n\nActually, I don't think I can make it.\n\nOh, why not?\n\nI just remembered.\n\nI can make it, so I will see you there.\n\nOkay, bye.\n\n[TROPICAL MUSIC.]\n\nI don't understand why John hasn't made more progress.\n\nYou've done so much to make him feel special.\n\nI know.\n\nI recreated the private tour of the Louvre where they let you touch all the art.\n\nWe rode Aquamans through the water.\n\nI got so many beauty treatments I fear my hair may be too shiny and lustrous.\n\nWe've been getting on quite well, but every time I bring up self-improvement, he just shuts me down.\n\nI haven't encountered this much resistance since I tried to get Timoth\xc3\xa9e Chalamet to go out into the sun.\n\nYou know, I looked at John's files again.\n\nHe was hardly a shrinking violet.\n\nIf you think he needs help, maybe you should just tell him directly.\n\nPerhaps you're right.\n\nI shall go on the attack, just like six of the eight \"Game of Thrones\" characters who were based on me would do.\n\n[QUIETLY.]\n\nYeah.\n\nSo how are things going with Chidi?\n\nSuper easy.\n\nAll I have to do is be myself, and he's constantly freaking out.\n\nYou have that effect on people, bud.\n\nWhat else can we do to mess up his life?\n\nListen, E-dog, I know people don't look to me for plans or ideas or anything, but maybe we should ease off.\n\nHe's pretty stressed already.\n\nPlease.\n\nHe's not even dry-heaving yet.\n\nHow many Tums did he take today?\n\n- Like 20.\n\n- Pfft, that's nothing.\n\nWe don't stop until it's a whole bottle.\n\nBecause the more miserable he is, the more he's going to teach you, and then everyone, and then he'll save humanity.\n\nHe's like Superman with nervous diarrhea.\n\nGet ready.\n\nI'm gonna make that speech soon.\n\nHey, girl.\n\nWant to hit up the spa tomorrow?\n\nI want to try that new \"Little Mermaid\" treatment, the one where they remove your vocal chords and it somehow makes your legs look amazing.\n\nPerhaps, but I was hoping to bend your ear on a more serious matter.\n\n\n\nThe things you used to write, frankly were hurtful.\n\nWhat?\n\nName one.\n\nI gained five pounds, and you called me Ta-Hammy All-the-Meals.\n\nI mean, that's just poetry.\n\nWell, you were so mean to Daniel Day-Lewis, - he quit acting.\n\n- Oh, I'm sorry, was he living in character as a man who thought he could pull off boot-cut jeans?\n\nYou know what?\n\nI see what this is.\n\nThis has been a fake

here.\n\nB'scuse me?\n\nYou're telling me to be better?\n\nWhile you were gallivanting around with your fancy friends, I lived in the real world, so I had bills to pay.\n\nI worked 16 hours a day by myself building a site with millions of readers.\n\nYou're the one with issues, sweetheart.\n\nIf you spot it, you got it.\n\nWhoosh.\n\nThat's another deuce for the gossip toilet.\n\n[EXHALES

actual desire will appear, and who knows what that is?\n\nI do.\n\nMy old motorcycle with Pamela Anderson airbrushed on the side.\n\nIt exploded a week after I got it because someone wanted to see what would happen if they poured lighter fluid in the engine.\n\nWas that someone you?\n\nYep.\n\nTurns out it explodes.\n\nCalled it.\n\nLook, maybe Jianyu the monk likes motorcycles.\n\nWe don't know his life.\n\nNo monk's truest desire is a motorcycle with Pam Anderson's face painted on it.\n\nOh, it wasn't her face.\n\n[SLOW MOTION.]\n\nNo!\n\nA sexually explicit motorcycle?\n\nWhose rock was that?\n\n[GRUNTS.]\n\nHey, it's mine.\n\nJianyu tossed my rock because he wanted to help me, his friend, who loves motorcycles and Canadian TV actress Pamela Anderson.\n\nThanks, Jianyu.\n\nAnd now I will ride it away.\n\n[MISCHIEVOUS MUSIC.]\n\nCan't wait to cruise the streets in this bad boy.\n\nYeah, man.\n\nNow we're cooking with gas.\n\nWell, this was a huge success.\n\nChidi's an absolute mess.\n\nOh, we should pop open some champagne.\n\nCall those magic ants.\n\nHe's clearly being tested like never before.\n\nYeah, and now we need to ramp up the pressure.\n\nEleanor, he told an outright lie.\n\nWe don't want him so freaked out that he can't help anyone else.\n\nI think we did enough for the day.\n\nNo way, dude.\n\nWe can't stop now.\n\nWe have to push him to the edge.\n\nWe have to knead his fragile psyche until he's hyperventilating - and losing his mind.\n\n- [KNOCKS ON DOOR.]\n\nHi, guys, um - can we talk?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nI need to tell you a secret.\n\nI [HYPERVENTILATES.]\n\nI can't [INHALES.]\n\n[SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC.]\n\n\n\nNo, no, guys, guys, not now.\n\nI Spent my whole life on Earth battling a stomach ache because I never knew what to do.\n\nAnd for a while here, that was gone, but recently, I've been miserable.\n\nWhy, Chidi?\n\nYou're in the Good Place.\n\nI know, but I have this problem, and if I choose option A [GULPS.]\n\nBut if I choose option B [EXHALES.]\n\nNo.\n\nYou know, Chidi, sometimes adversity can lead to growth.\n\nWhatever the moral dilemma is, maybe you'll come out on the other side better for it.\n\nYeah.\n\nNo.\n\nI'm used to moral dilemmas.\n\nI like moral dilemmas.\n\nThey're my jam, but this just feels like I'm - What?\n\n- Like I'm being punished somehow.\n\nAnd, obviously, I know that's silly.\n\nThis is the Good Place.\n\nYou two would never do anything to hurt anyone, but I am seriously worried that I did something wrong, and this is the universe getting back at me.\n\n[CRIES.]\n\nOh, no.\n\n[WHIMPERS.]\n\nWhat's happening now?\n\nOh, no.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\nNo, I made God cry?\n\n[CRYING.]\n\nOh, stomach ache.\n\nWelcome back, old friend.\n\nI can't believe John.\n\nThe man who once started a protracted Twitter feud with Jacob Tremblay thinks I'm the one with issues?\n\nMaybe you need to be even more direct with him.\n\nLike, punch him in the face.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI'm fired up.\n\nYou've just been very nice to him and I don't like the way he's treating you.\n\nMaybe it's not possible.\n\nWe're just too different.\n\nHe spent his life in the bowels of the Internet, jealous and miserable with no real friends, while I spent my life in the upper echelon of society jealous and miserable with no real friends.\n\nOh, Janet.\n\nI've been going about this all wrong.\n\nExactly.\n\nHere you go.\n\nOh, uh no, I'm Why?\n\nWhy are you crying?\n\nThis is all my fault.\n\nI promised I'd take care of you, Chidi.\n\n- You did?\n\n- Yes.\n\nI promised.\n\nUh, see, Chidi, the Architect is responsible for the entire Neighborhood, so a resident suffering in any way, it's very painful for her.\n\nActually, come here.\n\nCome here.\n\nBut don't worry.\n\nWe have a very simple solution for problems here.\n\nOh, good.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWe eliminate them.\n\nSo you just tell us a problem, and we'll eliminate it, like, say you had a problem with that vase.\n\n- [GASPS.]\n\n- [CHUCKLES.]\n\nSee?\n\nSo just tell me what's bothering you, I'll wave my hand, it'll explode, and you can go back to your otherwise perfect life.\n\nUh the motorcycle.\n\nYep.\n\nThat's my problem.\n\nFor some reason, it just hasn't been bringing me as much happiness as maybe it wasn't intended to, so I'd just as soon get rid of it.\n\nDone.\n\nOh, not again.\n\nNo more motorcycle.\n\n- Problem solved.\n\n- Great.\n\nUh, Eleanor, I hope you feel better.\n\nNo, no, she'll be fine.\n\nShe'll be fine.\n\nJohn, I have something to say.\n\nRound two.\n\nLet's do this.\n\nIn 2007, Blake Lively invited me to a birthday party held for Leonardo DiCaprio aboard Paul Allen's mega-yacht.\n\nI see we're dropping names three at a time now.\n\nThe guest list was 100 of the wealthiest, most famous members of the glitterati.\n\nOnce aboard, I discovered there was a VIP deck.\n\nAnd within that area, there was an even more exclusive room that you could only access with a secret PIN, which I promptly entered.\n\nAnd guess who was waiting for me.\n\nI hate to admit it, but I have to know.\n\nWho?\n\nNo one.\n\nI was the only one there.\n\nThe party raged on outside, but I was so obsessed with status that I never left.\n\nI spent the entire night talking to no one.\n\nRiveting story.\n\nIf only it were longer and sadder.\n\nThe point is, if all you care about in the world is the velvet rope, you will always be unhappy no matter which side you're on.\n\nYou and I are proof of that.\n\nBut now we're here.\n\nCan we just start over?\n\nWell if we're gonna be friends, I need to say something.\n\n[SOFT TROPICAL MUSIC.]\n\nI really am sorry for all the posts I wrote about you.\n\nAnd everything I tweeted.\n\nAnd scrawled on the back of a playbill during the intermission of \"Wicked\" and had someone pass it to you and say it was from an anonymous concerned citizen.\n\n- That was you?\n\n- [CLICKS TONGUE.]\n\nWell, my bangs were making my ears look chunky.\n\nThat was a fair hit.\n\n[LAUGHTER.]\n\nIt's a lovely night.\n\nWould you like to go for a walk?\n\n- [MIMICKING GUITAR SOLO.]\n\n- Okay, Jason, new plan.\n\nInstead of just trying to not get caught, we're going to study ethics.\n\nI'm going to help you become a good person.\n\nOh, dope.\n\nI always want to get better.\n\nThat's why I spent so much of my time at the free clinic.\n\nHang on.\n\nJust editing my syllabus in my head based on that comment.\n\nThis is gonna be awesome.\n\nYou rule.\n\nYou're like the Pam Anderson boob motorcycle of people.\n\nThank you.\n\nThat's an amazing compliment.\n\nAnd I'm sorry your actual motorcycle blew up.\n\nOh, that's okay, homie.\n\nThat's just what motorcycles do.\n\nSo Chidi's set with Jason now.\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nA little better.\n\nBut still terrible.\n\nYou were torturing him because that's what we had to do.\n\nI know.\n\nBut I went too far.\n\nAnd what's worse I liked it.\n\nBecause I'm angry at him.\n\nFor leaving me.\n\nWhich isn't even remotely fair, because he sacrificed himself for us.\n\nBut I'm still angry he abandoned me, which makes me feel guilty, which makes me angry, which makes me want to talk to Chidi because he's the person I go to when I'm angry.\n\nSo it's a real fun cycle.\n\nI still don't have a grip on the human emotional spectrum.\n\nYou guys are often happy when you should be sad and angry when you should be happy, and texting when you should be driving, which is not an emotion, I know, but it's insane.\n\n\n\nThe point is, in this case, even if it's not rational, you're allowed to feel a little angry.\n\nLet yourself off the hook.\n\nProcess it and work your way through it, and then get your shirt together.\n\nBecause we have a lot of work to do.\n\n[KNOCKING AT DOOR.]\n\nMorning, all.\n\nAnyone interested in a status report?\n\nI win.\n\nI mean, I'll start.\n\nI have made massive progress with John.\n\nGreat.\n\nIs he gonna join Chidi's class?\n\nPhilosophy may not be his way forward.\n\nGenuine human connection shall be his course of study.\n\nAnd first up on the syllabus, he and I will be unironically watching the Britney Spears movie \"Crossroads\" together [CHUCKLES.]\n\n\n\nAnd you'll have to trust me, this is a huge step in the right direction.\n\nWonderful work, Tahani.\n\nAnd, Jason, I mean, bravo.\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nIt's been a tough couple weeks, and it just felt really good to be brainy and have a useness.\n\nSure, bud.\n\nWell, I think we can finally say that all four of these mofos are on the right

I give him a beer.\n\nI'm just glad he stopped asking me to go to dinner so we could discuss my career.\n\nMan, we haven't done a successful activity in, like, three weeks.\n\nWe're ice cold.\n\nGuys, give yourself a break.\n\nThey're getting better.\n\nBrent stopped saying \"daddy like\" all the time.\n\nThat's something.\n\nSomething feels off.\n\nAll right, we need new ideas.\n\nI say we hole up here for an all-night - brainstorming session.\n\n- Now just hang on.\n\nWe're working really hard, and we need to relax occasionally, or we're gonna just burn out.\n\nSo let's just, you know, clear our brain, watch a movie, or oh!\n\nWe'll have a slumber party.\n\n- - [SCREEN BEEPING]\n\nWhat the fork?\n\n[DRAMATIC MUSIC]\n\nWhoever you are, show yourself.\n\nOh.\n\nHold on.\n\nThe hood is caught in my glasses.\n\nHi.\n\nI'm Glenn from the Bad Place.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nYeah, what do you want, creep?\n\nNo one knows I'm here, and I have some important information.\n\nEleanor, I need to speak with you alone.\n\nWhatever you need to say to me, you can say right here.\n\nI don't think I should.\n\nIt would lead to a very uncomfortable social situation.\n\nSay it.\n\nThat's not Michael.\n\nThat's Vicky the Demon in a Michael suit.\n\nAnd she's sabotaging your experiment.\n\nYou see?\n\nIt's uncomfortable.\n\nAll right, just sit there quietly until we sort all this out.\n\nIf it's not too much trouble, could I get a hot glass of pig urine?\n\nWe need to talk.\n\nOr I'm not picky.\n\nWhatever urine you have is fine.\n\nEleanor, you have to believe me.\n\nI'm Michael.\n\nHe's lying.\n\nCalm down, dude.\n\nI trust you.\n\nBut I'm gonna make Glenn think I don't trust you.\n\nSomehow this has to be related to the problems we've been having here.\n\nAnd we need to figure out what game they're playing.\n\nOoh, that's good.\n\nI like the way you think, Shellstrop.\n\nI mean, I hate the way you think, Shellstrop!\n\nIs he buying it?\n\nHe's not looking.\n\nI'll tell you whatever you want to know, but shouldn't we call The Judge?\n\nWe're not calling anyone until we figure some things out.\n\n- We have questions.\n\n- Yeah, for example, if you're a devil, how come you're not wearing Prada?\n\n[GASPS]\n\nCaramel!\n\nWhy would you help us?\n\nOne day, you're flattening penises, and the next, you just decide to defect?\n\nActually, one of my jobs was to reinflate the penises so they could get flattened again.\n\nIt doesn't matter.\n\nListen, I loved torturing humans because I thought they deserved it.\n\nThey said everyone in the Bad Place was evil and beyond repair.\n\nI don't know if I believe that anymore.\n\nAlso, Shawn is so mean, you guys.\n\nHe yells at me all the time.\n\nIt's, like, unnecessary.\n\nI feel you, dog.\n\nI was yelled at my whole life.\n\nPeople were always like, \"You didn't pay for that!\" \"How do you plead?\" \"He's flatlining!\" \"Clear!\" Okay, well, if that's Vicky, what's the Bad Place's plan?\n\nTo sow chaos turn you guys against each other, ruin the experiment.\n\nAlso, I have proof that's not Michael.\n\nHere are pictures of Vicky wearing the Michael suit.\n\nThis doesn't prove anything.\n\nThese could just be pictures - of the real Michael.\n\n- They're real.\n\nI know because I helped make the suit.\n\nI couldn't figure out how to make it contain your demon essence, so you'll have to wear it over the Vicky suit.\n\nUgh, really?\n\nYou're the worst, Glenn.\n\nLet's do it.\n\nZip her up.\n\nOkay, but if I melt, I am gonna be, like, so annoyed.\n\nHuh.\n\nPretty well-made.\n\nI can really feel all the musty skin folds, and and the dangly bits.\n\nThe voice is perfect.\n\nYou sound so much like him, I want to punch you.\n\nAre we sure it's okay that we made this?\n\nI mean, what are you gonna use it for?\n\nWhat are you gonna use it shut up, Glenn.\n\nThe experiment is about to begin.\n\nLet's call the real Michael and send him spiraling down the toilet bowl like the pinched turd he is.\n\nWell, now, we know you're lying because Michael would've definitely told us if the Bad Place had called him and showed him some freakin' Michael suit.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOf course I would've.\n\nI mean, Janet would have phone records.\n\nYou could just ask her to pull them up.\n\nOkay, fine.\n\nI lied.\n\n- They called me.\n\n- What?\n\nI lied about that.\n\nAnd I'm sorry.\n\nYou knew about this?\n\nYes, yes, but there's there's a good explanation.\n\nYeah, the explanation is that's Vicky, and she's lying to you about everything.\n\nCall The Judge and we'll settle this once and for all.\n\nOr is that exactly what you wanted us to do?\n\nThat is what I want you to do.\n\nExactly.\n\nEleanor, perhaps we should call The Judge.\n\nGlenn was telling the truth.\n\nNo, The Judge said if anything else went wrong, she would reset the whole experiment.\n\nWe are not calling her unless we have no other choice, and I am locking you two jamokes in separate rooms until we get to the bottom of this.\n\nUgh!\n\nI'm very upset about this development.\n\nI'm serious, man.\n\nThis is happening.\n\nOh.\n\nI'm very upset about this development.\n\nAll right, buttheads, what do we do?\n\nI say we trust Michael.\n\nHe's our friend.\n\nWait, might be our friend, or he might be a lying trickster who just looks like our friend the classic Mary-Kate Olsen.\n\nI have to say, we've had a lot of misfires recently, and Michael has been acting suspiciously.\n\n\n\nLike tonight, when I wanted to work, and he just wanted to have a slumber party instead?\n\nTo be fair to Mike, slumber parties rule.\n\nAnd why would we trust Glenn?\n\n- He's a demon.\n\n- So is Michael.\n\n- Demons can be good.\n\n- Right.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo it's decided.\n\nWe trust both of them.\n\nOkay.\n\nPredictably, this was unhelpful.\n\n[QUIRKY MUSIC]\n\nGet in there.\n\nWhat is all this stuff?\n\n- Are these weapons?\n\n- [SOFT BEEP]\n\nOoh, don't touch those.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nThose are my special magnet handcuffs.\n\nThey make me feel silly when Mindy and I are playing Upstairs-downstairs Derek.\n\nOh, they're sex toys.\n\nUgh, they're sex toys.\n\nDude, get out of here.\n\nWe have enough problems.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nMy good man, allow me to bury the hatchet.\n\nBeing rebooted again has evolved me past any feelings of jealousy.\n\n- [CHIMES JINGLING]\n\n- Oh, I know that sound.\n\nLooks like someone found my sex diaper.\n\nI'll leave you guys alone to live that dipe life.\n\n- Ugh.\n\n- Eugh!\n\nOkay, explain yourself if yourself even is yourself.\n\nI am Michael.\n\nShawn did call me, and I saw the Michael suit.\n\nHe said if the experiment failed, he was gonna use it to make you think I was torturing you.\n\nWhy didn't you tell us?\n\nBecause he said he would just erase your memories of me telling you, so it wouldn't matter anyway.\n\nHe thought that I would crumble under the pressure.\n\nBut a month ago, you told me you only pretended to freak out in order to get me to step up and become a leader.\n\n\n\nYes, that also was a lie, but it was an inspirational one.\n\nLike, \"So great running into you.\n\nWe should get coffee some time,\" or all of Instagram.\n\nSo to recap, you found out the Bad Place made a Michael suit, freaked out, didn't tell us why, and then later, you lied to me about why you freaked out?\n\nAnd then you lied again just a few minutes ago when you said that you never got a call from Shawn.\n\n\n\nYes, but that lie was only to cover my two earlier lies.\n\nI mean, that's gotta be okay, right?\n\nWhat?\n\nEleanor, don't you see what they're doing?\n\nShawn sent Glenn to undermine our trust in each other so you'll call The Judge and restart the experiment.\n\nWell, I have no reason not to believe you, other than the three very recent examples we just laid out.\n\nHuddle.\n\nNow.\n\n- [DOOR SLAMS]\n\n- [SOFT BEEP]\n\nOh, hey, sorry.\n\nI just needed to grab this.\n\nYou know, it's chime time.\n\n[SOFT BEEP]\n\nThere's gotta be a way to figure out if that's the real Michael.\n\nIs there a way you can make some sort of demon lie detector?\n\nOof.\n\nI don't know.\n\nThe Janet babies are still draining me, and I just had to put down Daisy the horse blob, which was exhausting emotionally and physically.\n\nShe fought back.\n\nI won't get into details.\n\nI had to twist her head off.\n\nSorry.\n\nNo more details.\n\nShe did thrash.\n\nShe thrashed.\n\n- Sorry.\n\n- Okay, why don't we just get him drunk so he starts blabbing?\n\nI mean, what goes best with pig urine?\n\n- Coconut rum.\n\n- That won't work on a demon.\n\nI'll try and make a lie detector.\n\nOh, no.\n\nDamn it.\n\nWhat's going on in there?\n\nI touched the dang diaper.\n\nGet back in that room.\n\nSo Michael saw the suit.\n\nBig deal.\n\nI still think you're forking with us.\n\nI think this is just like when the Bad Place sent us Linda, who turned out to be some super-jacked punching guy, and just like him, you got busted.\n\nThat's the thing.\n\nThe puncher didn't get busted.\n\nIt worked exactly as planned.\n\nThe whole thing was a diversion to get real Michael out, and sneak the imposter in on a train.\n\nIt must've happened during the handoff.\n\nWhile Janet was handcuffing Chris, a bunch of demons must've grabbed Michael, yanked him away, and then Vicky, in the Michael suit, walked back out.\n\nYou never would've known the difference.\n\nAlso, when Chris got back, I saw Shawn and him celebrating.\n\nWhy would they be happy if he wasn't supposed to get caught?\n\nMan, I love a good sabotage.\n\nOr is that exactly what you want us to think?\n\nMotherforker.\n\nI knew there was something weird about that puncher.\n\nI said that to Michael and he dismissed it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSee what I mean?\n\nDon't go anywhere.\n\nCome on.\n\n[DOOR CLOSES]\n\nIf Michael is just Vicky in a Michael suit, let's just take the suit off.\n\nYeah.\n\nMaybe we could sneak up behind him, and try and pants him from forehead.\n\nThat won't work.\n\nA demon can take his own skin suit off, but no one else can.\n\nIt's like a very complicated bra.\n\nWell, so be it.\n\n[DOOR OPENS]\n\nTake off your skin suit.\n\n- I can't.\n\n- Sure, you can.\n\nYou're either a demon wearing a Michael suit, or you're a demon wearing a Vicky suit who's wearing a Michael suit over that.\n\nJust take off your Michael suit, and show us what you're working with.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI won't.\n\n- That's very suspicious.\n\n- I know, but I'm not Vicky.\n\nI just don't want to show you what's underneath here.\n\nI've seen a lot of weird hogs in my life, dude.\n\n- Get over yourself.\n\n- That's not it.\n\nI'm a fire squid.\n\nDope.\n\nNo.\n\nNot dope.\n\nI'm a 6,000-foot tall fire squid.\n\nI have tentacles.\n\nThere's teeth everywhere.\n\nI'm on fire, and my neck is long.\n\nAnd there's a smell, and lots of juice.\n\nThere's so much juice, El.\n\nI think I speak for everyone here when I say I really have to see this.\n\nSo you're not gonna take off your demon Spanx because you're shy?\n\nWell, that's convenient.\n\nEleanor, if I take off this suit, I will crash through the roof and the entire Neighborhood will see me and the experiment will be blown.\n\nBut it's more than that.\n\nYou guys will never look at me the same way again.\n\nI won't just be Michael.\n\nI'll be some disgusting mass of burning tentacles.\n\nDo you really want to be friends with something like that?\n\nYes.\n\nI keep saying.\n\nEleanor.\n\n\n\nNow I don't know if this will work, but theoretically, if you point it at a demon and he's lying, it'll turn red.\n\nIf he's telling the truth, it'll turn green.\n\nOkay.\n\nGlenn.\n\nThis is a lie detector.\n\nLet us show you how it works.\n\n- [DEVICE WHIRRS]\n\n- What's your name?\n\nWell, everyone calls me Glenn, but the name on my demon certificate is actually Snakes Pour Forth From His Anu - [SHRIEKS]\n\n- [GROANS]\n\nGlenn blew up.\n\nGlenn blew up.\n\nOr is that exactly what he wants us to think?\n\nSo does blowing up mean he was telling the truth or lying?\n\nNeither.\n\nThat was not supposed to happen.\n\nI've never k*lled anybody before.\n\nNo, don't worry.\n\nDemons can't die.\n\nHe'll slowly reform himself over a few months, passing through all the stages of demon growth larva, slug monster, spooky little girl, teenage boy, giant ball of tongues, social media CEO, and then finally demon, so Look at the bright side.\n\nThis worked out perfectly.\n\nI mean, not for Glenn, obviously, but for us.\n\nLying demon's gone.\n\nWe're still here.\n\nAll good.\n\nNo.\n\nWe're not all good, man.\n\nYou're either Michael and you lied, or you're Vicky in a Michael suit.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna go for a walk.\n\nNobody go anywhere.\n\n[MELLOW MUSIC]\n\n- Chidi?\n\n- Hey.\n\nHey, I didn't think anyone would still be up.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nYeah, yeah, I'm just practicing drawing viable horses ones that aren't crimes, you know, against nature.\n\nOkay, I know this mood of yours from reading your file and whatnot.\n\n\n\nWhy don't you take a break, and we'll get some food in you?\n\nWell, I'm done.\n\nI scooped it all up into one steaming pile of Glenn.\n\nMaybe I can put him back together.\n\nI'm hella good at puzzles.\n\nI finished this word search in, like, 30 seconds.\n\nJason, I feel terrible.\n\nI know he was a demon and he may have lied to us, but he didn't deserve that.\n\nYou were only trying to help us.\n\nLook, I know this is a weird time, but if you ever want to talk, just know that I'm here for you, girl.\n\nThanks, Jason.\n\nThat means a lot.\n\n[TENDER MUSIC]\n\nMmm.\n\nI gotta say.\n\nOut of all the human stuff I've been able to experience in this neighborhood, nachos number one.\n\n- Easy.\n\n- Really?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, salty, crunchy, cheesy, little bit of a kick?\n\nName one better thing humans have created.\n\nThe

know.\n\nI just feel like I made the world a little bit worse, and I won't be okay until I make it better again.\n\nMaking yourself miserable to ease the suffering of others about the most Chidi thing you can do.\n\nI'll see you later.\n\nDo you want to take the rest of the those nachos?\n\nYeah, I do.\n\nThank you.\n\nOkay, here's where I'm at.\n\nI just don't know if I can ever trust you.\n\nI'm gonna call The Judge.\n\nWe'll start over.\n\nWe won't have Chidi in the mix, but he'll be on our side again, which is almost as good.\n\nBut we know the humans now.\n\nStarting over sounds exhausting.\n\nI know, but if that's not Michael, he could sabotage us in ways we can't even perceive, and even if it is, I can't fully trust him, so every time something goes wrong, a little part of me is gonna wonder.\n\nWe have to start over.\n\nI have a better idea.\n\nI'm gonna blow myself up.\n\n- ALL: What?\n\n- I'll blow myself up.\n\nThat way, you can continue the experiment with Chidi as one of the people, which is our best chance to ever be successful.\n\nWhy not just lock you in a room or in Janet's void or something?\n\nBut then you might worry that I'd escape.\n\nI blow myself up, I'm out of your hair for good.\n\nWell, parts of me will be in your actual hair, - but you get it.\n\n- Michael, wait.\n\nTahani, this is the only way.\n\nThere's literally noting I can say that will make you realize that I'm really me.\n\nOh, boy.\n\nThis is gonna suck.\n\nHopefully, I will see you all in a few months.\n\nGood luck.\n\nOh, and make sure that you, uh, get all of me into the container, or I might come back way shorter.\n\nAnd that would bum me out.\n\n[DEVICE WHIRRS]\n\nI wish I were saying this in different circumstances but Take it sleazy.\n\nMichael, wait!\n\n[HANDCUFFS WHIRR]\n\nOh, crud nuts.\n\nJason, how did you know that was bad Janet?\n\nMichael said there's nothing he could say that would make you realize he's really him, but Janet does have a thing she can say that does make me realize she is really not her.\n\nWhat?\n\nI called Janet \"girl,\" but she didn't say, \"Not a girl. \" The real Janet always says, \"Not a girl. \" [LAUGHING]\n\nOh, wow.\n\nThat realization is the only thing that stopped me from becoming a pile of goo.\n\n- Oh.\n\n- [DEVICE CLATTERS]\n\nWait, how did you pull it off?\n\nYou were outside on the platform with me the whole time.\n\nWe brought two bad Janets on the train, you dumb, dumb idiot.\n\nThe other one distracted you on the platform while good Janet brought Chris onto the train.\n\n\n\nI snuck out, marbelized Janet, and then I took over, baby.\n\nStupid Michael never knew.\n\nI had you fartknockers fooled for weeks, until Glenn the traitor ruined everything.\n\n- That guy sucks, right?\n\n- [GOO BUBBLES]\n\nShut up, Glenn.\n\n- [GOO BUBBLES]\n\n- Wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\nBad Janets can't impersonate Good Janets.\n\nI've seen them try.\n\nTheir heads melt, so

Janet didn't dump me.\n\nHer weird sister did.\n\nEverything makes so much more sense.\n\nAll of Janet's ideas were so counterproductive.\n\nShe brought the horse monster to life.\n\nShe forced me to antagonize John.\n\nShe got us to doubt Eleanor's leadership skills.\n\nOh, I was just about to launch an idea where Tahani was gonna give herself an asymmetrical haircut.\n\nYou monster.\n\nThank you!\n\nGuys, we still have a problem here.\n\nYou still don't have evidence that I'm actually me.\n\nSure, we do.\n\nYou offered to sacrifice yourself to help a bunch of cockroaches.\n\nThat's about

course, though I'd never serve finger sandwiches at a lake house.\n\nI mean, what am I?\n\nWelsh?\n\nAre you?\n\nI don't know.\n\nNo, right?\n\nOkay, we have to move quietly.\n\nWe can't be seen by anyone until we get to Shawn.\n\nIt's the only way to rescue Janet.\n\nUh, Michael?\n\nI'm scared.\n\nMe too, bud.\n\nI mean, what if all this time apart has changed me and Janet's relationship?\n\nWhat if that special connection is gone?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, for me, it's scary that we're standing in the birth place of evil surrounded by billions of demons who want to destroy us.\n\nHmm, I guess we both have things we're scared about.\n\nHello, all!\n\nI took the liberty of preparing a few simple snacks.\n\nWhew, this place is nice!\n\nDid anyone else see that movie \"The Lake House\" with Keanu and Sandy B?\n\nOh, I love a movie with gentle magic.\n\nGive me a time-traveling mailbox or a mother-daughter body switch, or like, uh, Sarah Michelle Gellar as a chef and her food tastes amazing because she cries in it?\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nI should've been a screenwriter.\n\nYeah, this'll do.\n\nI guess.\n\nI got dibs on the master bedroom.\n\nUm, Simone, where's Chidi?\n\nHe decided to just stay at home and read.\n\nHe said swimming in lakes scares him.\n\nTo be fair, most things scare him.\n\nWell, never fear, you all stay and enjoy the full-sized sandwiches.\n\nI shall go and fetch Chidi.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nTahani is on the job.\n\nPerv 'stache, four-eyes, bee monster.\n\nWhoa, is that you?\n\n- - Technically, yes.\n\nThat's a version of me I no longer recognize.\n\nBehind that handsome smile was so much cruelty, so much pain inflicted on so many with such a glee.\n\nShameful.\n\nWhat echoes of this former self await me here?\n\nI feel you.\n\nIt was always for me hard to go back to my old high school.\n\nSo many memories.\n\nAlso the junkyard machine crushed it into tiny cubes.\n\nIf we get out of here alive, remind me to re-erase your teen years.\n\n[LIGHT MUSIC]\n\nCome on, guys.\n\nHurry back.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nOh, hey, Wanda.\n\n- Everything okay?\n\n- Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.\n\nCome again?\n\nWhoa.\n\nBarg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.\n\n- Derek!\n\n- Oh, hey!\n\nSo, uh, things are not going well.\n\n- Hi, there.\n\n- Hi, there!\n\nYou said you could handle this!\n\nYeah, well, it turns out being a single father to 300 kids is not that easy, Eleanor.\n\nOkay, well, the four humans are still at the lake house.\n\nSo we can figure this out.\n\n- Oh.\n\n- What are you doing here?\n\nI came to get Chidi.\n\nHe decided to stay home.\n\nChidi's up there?\n\nRight now?\n\nOh, Chidi.\n\nThere you are.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI should've told you.\n\nI decided to just stay home and read.\n\nSwimming in lakes scares me, and so does waterskiing.\n\nWe know all that, Chidi.\n\nWe never expected you to meet the group at the lake house.\n\nWe had a special solo activity planned for you.\n\n- Really?\n\nWhat is it?\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\nWe have hidden several clues in this apartment to a puzzle.\n\nOoh!\n\nI love puzzles!\n\nThey're so much fun, but they're also like homework.\n\n- Win-win.\n\n- Well, this one's a doozy because when you solve it, you get the answer to the truth about the universe.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nSpoiler alert, I guess.\n\nHey, Tahani, you've been so helpful, but everyone's back at the lake house with no party hostess, which is obviously less than ideal.\n\nSo go on.\n\nGet!\n\n- [CHUCKLES]\n\nOf course.\n\n- Yep.\n\n- Good luck, Chidi.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- [DOOR CLOSES]\n\n- So what's my first clue?\n\nYou've already gotten it.\n\nOoh!\n\n[INDISTINCT CHATTER]\n\nAll right, idiots, this is our 52 of the 4,000-hour presentation on the future of t*rture.\n\nHe's gonna be on stage for 4,000 hours?\n\n- Shh.\n\n- Here's what I think.\n\n- We should throw a Molotov - Jason!\n\nWhat?\n\nI didn't say cocktail.\n\nI could've meant Molotov anything.\n\n- You don't know.\n\n- Just trust me.\n\nI have a plan.\n\nHumans are worse than ever.\n\nWe have to innovate.\n\nSure, poking sticks work great, but should those sticks be sharper or hotter?\n\nShould they, counterintuitively, be less hot?\n\nLet's begin with slide number one of 7,000.\n\n- - [CLAPPING]\n\nNice speech.\n\nNot!\n\nWhat's up, dingus?\n\nOh, no.\n\nOh, that's not good.\n\nOh, what are you guys oh, no!\n\nDon't do that!\n\nThat's not Derek!\n\n- Derek.\n\n- [GROANS]\n\nI'm going back to the lake house to entertain because apparently that's all I'm good for.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Gonna need some party supplies cocktail napkins with a cute lake-related slogan.\n\nMaybe they can say, \"Better lake than never.\n\n\" [GROANS]\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI just got nothing left in the t*nk.\n\nDerek, when you get rebooted, you become more advanced, right?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Well, perhaps then you'd be more capable of controlling the neighborhood.\n\n- Hey, yeah, yeah!\n\n- You said you wanted to make this up to us.\n\nWell, now is your chance.\n\n- Yes!\n\n- Yes!\n\n- Derek!\n\n- [BEEP]\n\nWhat are you doing here, Vicky?\n\nYou're early, and do you ever take that suit off?\n\n- It smells terrible.\n\n- It does?\n\nNo need to be alarmed.\n\nI know this might look like Michael, the traitorous slampig.\n\nHowever, this is actually our very own Vicky wearing the latest in demon technology.\n\nA custom-made lookalike skin suit.\n\nSpin around for us, would you, hon?\n\nAs you are all aware, our current system suffers from diminishing returns.\n\nSure, the first time someone gets butthole spiders, he's miserable, but soon the humans get used to it.\n\nAnd worse, the spiders get bored.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- These personalized skin suits represent the dawn of a new era: t*rture 2. 0.\n\n- Oh.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\n- [CROWD MURMURING IN AMAZEMENT]\n\nAnd speaking of which, I figured DemonCon would be the best place to surprise you with my greatest invention.\n\nCome on out, Jason!\n\n[CROWD GASPS, APPLAUSE]\n\nI had the boys down in R&D make a Jason suit.\n\nI thought it'd be fun new way to t*rture Janet.\n\nCome on.\n\nCome on.\n\nHere you go.\n\nI didn't okay this.\n\nI know, but hey, I'm Vicky.\n\nI'm a total munch.\n\nThat you are.\n\nGood point.\n\nHmm.\n\nNot bad.\n\nThey went a little overboard on the cheekbones, but still.\n\nWait, - who's in there?\n\n- Glenn.\n\nMakes sense.\n\nGet an idiot to play an idiot.\n\nI was beginning to wonder where you were, Glenn.\n\nI'm right here in Jason.\n\nDefinitely not a big bucket of goo.\n\n[CLEARS THROAT]\n\nOkay.\n\nSay, boss, what do you say we put these innovative suits of yours to work?\n\nWe'll go t*rture Good Janet, and, uh, let you know how it goes.\n\n- Which way is it again?\n\n- Wait.\n\nI have a better idea.\n\nI say we t*rture Good Janet right here, right now live on stage.\n\nRufus, go get the Good Janet.\n\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n\nThis part of your plan seems risky.\n\nThis was not part of my plan.\n\nOh, thank God.\n\nI thought you had a bad plan.\n\nOkay, it's easy.\n\nJust hit the button.\n\nYou've seen Mindy do it a million times.\n\nYeah.\n\nHere we go.\n\n[CRYING]\n\nNo, no, no!\n\nDon't k*ll me, me.\n\nDon't do it!\n\n[GROANS]\n\nHuh.\n\nNow why is that so hard?\n\nI kinda you know what?\n\nI see what I gotta do.\n\nJust kind of look at this Derek!\n\n[LOW TONE]\n\n[CURIOUS MUSIC]\n\nExcellent.\n\nDude, what were you thinking?\n\nI just wanted to be useful.\n\nAll I ever get to do here is throw parties, which is all I ever got to do back on Earth.\n\nNow I've ruined everything.\n\nNo.\n\n- You gave us a way out.\n\n- So I fixed everything.\n\nNo, you've made things difficult in a new way, but I can make it work.\n\nWell, the important thing is, I did something.\n\nBe quiet and follow my lead.\n\n- Yes, ma'am.\n\n- Chidi?\n\nCome on out, bud.\n\nOkay!\n\nAm I close?\n\nNo, there's like 4,000 clues in here.\n\nYou found five.\n\nI'm just gonna skip to the end.\n\nThis puzzle was going to take you on adventures all over the neighborhood.\n\nHorseback riding, hot air ballooning, and I asked Tahani to be involved because she did all those things on Earth.\n\n\n\nYou've been in paradise for a month, and you're still so reluctant to try new activities.\n\nYeah, I know.\n\nI'm just not a \"new experience\" kind of guy.\n\nI mean, my comfort zone is basically, like, that chair, and honestly, the arms are a little sharp.\n\nI want you to believe that you're safe here, that you can trust me.\n\nDo you trust me, Chidi?\n\nYes.\n\nI really do.\n\nThen come with me.\n\nThese personalized skin suits are a true game changer.\n\nImagine being able to torment a human not as yourself, but as their wife or ex-wife, or just some mouthy broad.\n\n\n\nThey are so convincing, they even work on a Good Janet!\n\nOh.\n\nHey!\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\n[GROANS]\n\n\n\nGreat, more Vicky.\n\nHey, your Michael impression stinks almost as much as your suit.\n\nPfft.\n\nWhy does everyone keep saying that?\n\nWelcome, Janet.\n\nWe have a special guest for you today.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nHi, Janet, it's me.\n\nJason.\n\nYour boyfriend.\n\nI really miss you.\n\n[TENDER MUSIC]\n\nI know we were in a fight before, but I hope you've forgiven me because I love you, girl.\n\nNot a girl.\n\n- Well, Janet - Yeah?\n\nHow does that make you feel?\n\nTerrible!\n\n[SOBS]\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nAdequate work, Glenn.\n\nRufus, take the Janet back to her cell.\n\n- No, no, no.\n\n- Oh, no, please.\n\nUh, let us take Janet back ourselves.\n\nI wanna get a little extra t*rture time in on the way there.\n\nI don't see why not.\n\nHello, dummies!\n\nIt's me, Michael!\n\n- [CROWD CLAMORING]\n\n- I'm just kidding.\n\nIt's me, Vicky, in a Michael suit.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nI was never told that I had an understudy.\n\n[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]\n\nThere you go, buddy.\n\nYou're doing great.\n\nWhere are we going?\n\nUm, somewhere fun.\n\nJust follow my voice.\n\n[LOW TONE]\n\nOh.\n\nThis is, uh, kind of fun.\n\nI'm very scared, but also I like it?\n\n- Hi, there.\n\n- Hi, whoever you are.\n\nUh, don't mind us.\n\nWe're just doing a trust thing.\n\nHi, there.\n\n- [THUDDING]\n\n- What was that sound?\n\n- Uh, a unicorn died.\n\n- What?\n\nNo, I mean, not a unicorn.\n\nUh, my mistake.\n\nJust a a regular horse that someone stabbed in the head.\n\n- What?\n\n- [GRUNTS]\n\nWhat in the name of Kevin Spacey's self-made Christmas Eve video message to try to get back on \"House of Cards\" is going on here?\n\n- [WHISPERS]\n\nMichael.\n\n- Who are you?\n\nWho am I?\n\nYou had this the whole time?\n\nYeah, I wanted to explode a bunch of demons, but you told me I should wait.\n\n- So I did.\n\n- Vicky!\n\nWhy did you build a second Michael suit?\n\nHe didn't!\n\nNo, I mean, I didn't.\n\nUm, oh, look.\n\n[ZIPS]\n\n[CROWD MURMURING IN AMAZEMENT]\n\nIt can't be.\n\nYes, it's true.\n\nIt's me.\n\nThe real Michael.\n\nWe know all about your plot to sabotage our experiment.\n\nWe know you brought Chris in to pretend to be Linda to distract us while you planted a Bad Janet to pretend to be a Good Janet.\n\n- [APPLAUSE]\n\n- No, stop clapping!\n\nThis is real!\n\n- Someone capture them.\n\n- Rufus, I'm warning you.\n\nI know we go way back.\n\nWe used to be roommates.\n\nBut if you take another step, I will use this Demon Exploder on you.\n\nA Demon Exploder?\n\nCome on, man.\n\nAt least try to make that sound convincing.\n\n- [ZAP]\n\n- [ALL

as a part of the moral balance of the universe, but I've learned that's wrong.\n\nHumans are capable of self-improvement, and so are we.\n\nAnd down deep, Shawn knows this is true too.\n\nI beg you.\n\nOpen your eyes to the truth.\n\n[CLAPPING]\n\nBravo, Michael.\n\nWhat a monologue.\n\nNot!\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\n- [ZIPS]\n\nI'm not scared of you because I've gone there, Michael.\n\nI've become you.\n\nYou may act like you've changed, but deep down, you're still a demon.\n\nVile, ugly, capable of so much darkness.\n\nAnd now you're home.\n\n[ZAP]\n\nOh, come on!\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nLet's go.\n\nCome on.\n\n- Let's go!\n\n- No, you morons!\n\nStop applauding them!\n\nThey're getting away!\n\nI swear, the production value at DemonCon gets better every year.\n\nMan, look at this house, and that beautiful lake.\n\nI can't believe I almost missed all this.\n\nIs this the answer to the truth about the universe?\n\n- Well - Uh, part of it.\n\nOoh!\n\nThe puzzle continues!\n\nHey, you decided to come after all.\n\nI did.\n\nThanks to Eleanor and Tahani.\n\nAw, you two are the best.\n\nThat was insane, but we got through it together.\n\nNo, we didn't.\n\nYou got through it.\n\nI almost ruined it a hundred times.\n\nFrom now on, I'm just gonna stick to throwing parties 'cause it's the only thing I'm good at.\n\n[SCOFFS, MOCKS CRYING]\n\n- Hey!\n\n- What?\n\nWhen I said throw a party, I didn't mean a pity party.\n\nThis isn't a pity party.\n\nI'm genuinely sad.\n\nThe only thing I can do is throw pointless parties.\n\nYou run the entire neighborhood.\n\nYou're so capable.\n\nI have seen you get stuck in any manner of crazy situation, and you always figure a way out.\n\nYeah, man, because I have had to scrape and claw my way through life, and you grew up in a castle full of diamond lamps and golden pillow cases.\n\nYou never learned how to think on your feet.\n\nLook, if the roles were reversed and I had to throw a fancy party to save all of humanity, I promise we'd be screwed because I wouldn't know what salad fork to put next to the whatever spoon.\n\n[INHALES]\n\nThe Whatever Spoon is really only used for certain festive jellies.\n\nSee?\n\nBabe, the dodos in that house are literally the four most important human beings in the universe.\n\nI wanted you to take care of them because I trust you.\n\nPlus, your parties aren't pointless.\n\nThey're opportunities for them to bond and form friendships.\n\nYou know, the thing we need them to do so we're not all tortured forever?\n\nYou're right, and thank you.\n\nBut if we ever get through this, I want to learn how to do something meaningful.\n\nA real skill.\n\nSomething helpful and fulfilling.\n\nOkay, man, if we survive this, I promise I will support you while you learn to weld or whatever.\n\n- [CHUCKLES]\n\n- Deal?\n\nDeal.\n\n[BRIGHT MUSIC]\n\n[expl*si*n]\n\nThat ought to stop them from following us.\n\nSo smart.\n\nNice to have you back, Janet.\n\nIt must've been hard for you to go back there.\n\nIt was.\n\nI don't like thinking about who I used to be.\n\nListen, Michael, it's okay to feel or plead guilty about bad things you used to do, but you don't have to feel shame about who you were because you are not a demon anymore.\n\nYou're just like a nice weird happy old dude.\n\nAh.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nThanks for rescuing me.\n\nI missed you so much.\n\nI missed you

story?\n\nIt looks boring.\n\nThis book is a part of the story.\n\n- You'll see.\n\n- [GROANS]\n\nIt all started about a week ago.\n\nWe had sent the four humans on a ski trip.\n\nAnd they all skied off a cliff and they broke all their bones and their pants fell down and you could see their butts.\n\nThe end.\n\nActually, it went better than we could have possibly hoped.\n\nWell, I admit it.\n\nI was wrong.\n\n- That was so fun.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nI mean, I couldn't actually go skiing because moving at an angle terrifies me.\n\nBut that lodge had so many reading nooks.\n\nJust everywhere you look, a nook!\n\nPlus, Jianyu guided us on that amazing meditation.\n\nOh, do you guys want to share what your mantra is?\n\nMine is Cate Blanchett saying \"Rihanna.\n\n\" Congrats again on the gin rummy win.\n\nI thought I was gonna take you down because I used to play all the time back in college.\n\nOh, you went to Rutgers, right?\n\nNo, I went to Princeton.\n\nYeah, I know.\n\nI'm messing with you.\n\nOh, ha, ha!\n\nNice one!\n\nHey, you were joking though, right?\n\nYou know it's Princeton?\n\nYeah, you know.\n\nOkay, team, well done.\n\nThey're all kind of k*lling it, but Brent has definitely made the most progress.\n\nYeah, when Simone beat him at cards, he didn't flip the table and storm off.\n\nHe just stormed off.\n\nThat's big!\n\nWell, we still don't know if he's really changed or if he's just trying to get into Super-Heaven.\n\nBut his behavior is changing.\n\nRemember, that's the road map.\n\nFirst, we change the behavior.\n\nThen, we work on motivation.\n\nAnd now - Oh!\n\n- The moment you've all been waiting for.\n\nThe Humanity Savior of the Week goes to - Jason!\n\n- Yes!\n\nKeep up the amazing work with Chidi.\n\nAnd the award for Hottest Savior of the Week

bit?\n\nIt was a real high point.\n\nThe ski trip, I mean.\n\nNot the completely rigged hotness contest.\n\nAll in all, it was the best we'd ever felt about the experiment.\n\nAnd then, Brent did something very Brent-y.\n\nWho could have predicted that?\n\nOh, hey, ski bunnies!\n\nSo, great news.\n\nI wrote a book.\n\nAnd since you're my nerdiest friends, you get to be the first to read it.\n\n\"Six Feet Under Par: A Chip Driver Mystery.\n\n\" Yeah, it's half spy novel, half m*rder mystery.\n\nIt's also half submarine adventure, half erotic memoir, and half political thriller.\n\nIt's also half golf tutorial and half commentary on society.\n\nSo it's 3 1/2 books in one?\n\nAt least.\n\nSo read it ASAP.\n\nI'm having a book-signing party and I want you to introduce me.\n\nYou know, talk about how great it is.\n\n- Oh.\n\n- Party's in two days, so chop-chop.\n\nTahani, cancel your plans.\n\nWe're gonna split a bottle of wine and read Brent's terrible novel out loud.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nPerhaps we shouldn't make fun.\n\nHe did seem nicer on the ski trip.\n\nHe made us all s'mores.\n\nThough, to be fair, he did also claim to have invented them.\n\nBefore you defend him, you might want to check out Chip Driver's love interest.\n\n[BRIGHT MUSIC]\n\nOh, no.\n\n\"Her name was Scarlett Pakistan, \"and she was the type of girl \"you couldn't take in all at once or you'd die.\n\n\"You had to take her in bit by bit, like a great work of art, like the Louvre.\n\n\" \"Her brown eyes were as brown as the brownest crayon.\n\n\"She had legs like Jessica Rabbit from that movie.\n\n\" \"Her long, flowing locks smelled like the moon at twilight on a par four?\n\n\" Ugh, I'm sorry about this.\n\nI've been through worse.\n\nOnce, at Elon Musk's birthday party, I was seated between Silvio Berlusconi and Elon Musk.\n\nThis is bad.\n\nBrent and Simone is our trickiest relationship.\n\nShe tends to make snap judgments about people, and he's a guy who repeatedly confirms the accuracy of her snap judgments.\n\nWe need her to believe that Brent is better than his worst actions, like saying that Tahani, \"Has an accent like the Queen of England, but without any of the old gross face parts.\n\n\n\n\" We felt like we could contain the fallout from Brent's book.\n\n\n\nBut as is often the case with these things, the negative effects started to ripple out.\n\nOh, like when someone throws up on a bus and then someone smells it, and they throw up?\n\nSure, yeah.\n\n- What's wrong, homie?\n\n- Brent wrote this book, and clearly, he put some of us in it.\n\nThere's a cowardly character named Four-Eyed Igby who wears glasses and sweater vests and never does anything spontaneous or cool.\n\nI am educating you in ethics.\n\nWhat could be cooler than that?\n\nIf you want to try something spontaneous, I'm your guy.\n\nAlmost everything I did on Earth, I did without thinking or worrying about what would happen.\n\nThat's how I got my nickname, \"The Defendant.\n\n\" Not the best argument, but you're right.\n\nWhat is something spontaneous that I can do right now?\n\nLet's come up with a list of ten possibilities and then slowly whittle it down over the next four days.\n\nBetter idea: let's dance, baby.\n\nHuh?\n\n[HEAVY TECHNO MUSIC]\n\nGet you out of your head.\n\nThis is how we defeat Igby, the no-fun nerd.\n\nOh.\n\n- Look at old Igby

development.\n\n[GROANS]\n\nCan you just skip to the end?\n\nNo.\n\nI need to tell you the whole story.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery story about humans ends the same way.\n\nJust tell me how they screwed up and put me out of my misery.\n\nYou're judging them too quickly.\n\nTrust me, I've spent a lot more time with people than you have.\n\nAnd I know literally everything that every one of them has ever done.\n\nDo you know what's happening right now on Earth?\n\nWars, murders, women in $400 yoga pants are refusing to vaccinate their children.\n\nVindictive nerds at Apple are changing the charging cable shape again.\n\nWhere does this hope come from, man?\n\nThis insane hope that people are worth the trouble.\n\nTo quote a terrible song by a terrible musician that people love so much they constantly put it in terrible movie trailers: humans are b-b-b-b-bad to the bone.\n\nWell, I think that they're g-g-g-good sometimes.\n\nAnd you should give them the b-b-b-benefit of the d-d-d-doubt.\n\nNow, where was I?\n\n[GROANS]\n\nSo, John had just accidentally discovered the truth about Jason.\n\nKeeping a secret like this is exactly the kind of thing that John struggled with on Earth.\n\n\n\nOr to put it in terms you'll understand, the gossip toilet was about to overflow.\n\nOh, I do understand that now.\n\nThank you.\n\nSo Jianyu is really Jason?\n\nFrom Florida?\n\nWho else knows about this?\n\nIs it just me?\n\n[GASPS]\n\nIs it an exclusive?\n\nYes, and we have to keep it that way.\n\nIf the truth comes out, we have no idea what will happen to Jason.\n\nYou don't know what you're asking of me.\n\nLook, the neighborhood is obviously amazing, but it's also a little season four of \"Downton Abbey.\n\n\" Beautifully designed, but a real snooze-fest.\n\nJason being a mistake is easily the most exciting thing that's happened since we got here!\n\nWhat if, in exchange for your discretion, Jason teaches you that \"Magic Mike\" body roll thing?\n\nHuh?\n\nI mean, you always said you wanted to learn that.\n\nFine.\n\nBut I want to learn the whole dance.\n\nWe hoped Simone would forget all about Brent's book, but unfortunately \"Chip Driver pulled up to the m*rder site \"in his 1968 Cadillac.\n\n\"'Keep it close' he growled to the valet, Luis.\n\n\"'Of course, Se\xc3\xb1or,' said Luis, who secretly admired Chip more than even his own father.\n\n\" \"Chip gazed at the sexy outline \"of the m*rder victim on the floor.\n\n\"'What a waste of curves,' he growled.\n\n\"He checked his Rolex\xa0\xa0watch, \"which was real.\n\n\"It was almost golf o'clock, \"so the case would have to wait.\n\n\"Good thing he'd already solved it.\n\nThe k*ller was Luis, the valet.\n\n\" He solves the m*rder on page ten.\n\nWhat is the rest of this book about?\n\n- How's it going, ladies?\n\n- Oh, you know, just delving into the great works of literature.\n\nYeah, so, listen, um maybe Brent made some insensitive choices, but could you possibly see your way to forgiving him?\n\n- I suppose - No.\n\nNo?\n\nSorry, but no, I can't.\n\nThis book is objectifying, misogynistic, and r*cist.\n\nWhy are we still dealing with this shirt in the Good Place?\n\n\n\nWhen people like him are ignorant jerks, why are people like us asked to forgive him?\n\nAlso, and this is less important, why is he in a fighter jet for his author photo?\n\nWell, I can answer the last one.\n\nIt's because he loves \"Top g*n.\n\n\" As for the other questions, I will get back to you after I consult a number of immortal beings who are very wise.\n\n[TENSE MUSIC]\n\nI didn't take you for a linksman.\n\nI appreciate golf.\n\nAs Ben Hogan once said, \"The most important shot in golf is the next one.\n\n\" That's a lovely idea.\n\nIf you make a mistake, you'll always have a chance to redeem yourself.\n\nYeah, well, as Jon Daly once said to David Lee Roth at the 2002 Chili's Pro-Am in Orlando: \"Suck on this drive, buttmunch.\n\n\" [ASCENDING]\n\nOoh!\n\nNailed it!\n\nThat was a flusher, but she sank.\n\nPerhaps an adept linksman like yourself should play with the assistance filter turned off?\n\n- Let's play old-school.\n\n- All right.\n\nWhy not?\n\n[WHOOSHING]\n\nFork!\n\nYou sneezed, man.\n\nI don't think I did, because I literally can't.\n\nWell, somebody sneezed.\n\nDamn it!\n\nBrent, buddy, nobody sneezed.\n\nYou hit a bad shot, and it's fine.\n\nYou know, it isn't a sign of weakness to admit that you screwed up.\n\nFine, whatever.\n\nI shanked it.\n\nThere you go.\n\nNow, let's go find your ball and try to do better on your next shot.\n\nAnd you know, if this ends up applying to any other aspect of your life later on, then cool.\n\n- What?\n\n- What?\n\nNothing.\n\nI gotta say, Bad Janet, I really felt like I had managed to stop the bleeding.\n\nYou thought that ding-dong would do a total personality 180 because of one gentle metaphor?\n\nWhat can I say?\n\nI'm an optimist.\n\nBut two days later at the event, it fell apart almost immediately.\n\nHey, thanks for not telling anyone about Jason.\n\nOh, well, ever since I arrived here, Tahani helped me realize that gossip was an unhealthy way for me to boost my self-esteem.\n\nBut on the other hand, this Jason tea needs to be spilled.\n\nJust try to remember what Emmanuel Kant said.\n\nIt is your duty to keep your friend's secrets.\n\nBut my favorite philosopher, Bethenny Frankel, would say that I have a duty to mention it all, and if you can't handle the truth, then you can't handle me!\n\nAnd once again, I beg you, please listen to Emmanuel Kant and not Bethenny Frankel.\n\nAh, well, I gotta goss about something.\n\nWhat about a few blind items that I picked up around the neighborhood?\n\nYou wanna know who wears the same dumb shorts every day?\n\n- No, I don't.\n\n- It's Dumb Shorts Cathy.\n\nSimone.\n\nUh, I have been thinking about those very good questions that you asked me.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for the delay.\n\nThe ancient scrolls I had to consult were very hard to roll back up.\n\nUm, anyway, I thought about what you should say to Brent when he asks for your opinion of his novel.\n\nMe, too.\n\nI have a great idea.\n\nI'm gonna tell him it sucks very hard.\n\nWell, listen, you're absolutely right that Brent needs to evolve, but there may be a more subtle way to make that happen.\n\nHey, there they are!\n\n- Charlie's Angels.\n\n- Ooh.\n\nSo did you finish the book?\n\nWhat did you think?\n\nWell, very interesting word choices.\n\nI've definitely never seen the word \"pants-tent\" used so many times.\n\nYeah, I kind of just felt like, in that moment, that that's what the Surgeon General would say.\n\nWhat else?\n\nLet's hear some more complos.\n\nCompliments.\n\nFor when you introduce me.\n\nJust writing a book is an amazing accomplishment.\n\nYou bet your butt it is.\n\nThe story is incredible, too.\n\nI mean, Chip solves the mystery on page ten.\n\nGreatest detective ever!\n\nSo hop on up there and just speak from the heart about how it's your favorite book ever.\n\nActually, I have to say, um the Scarlett Pakistan character is clearly based on Tahani, and it's not exactly flattering.\n\nNot flattering?\n\nI said she's got huge ones.\n\n- Ultimate complo!\n\n- Yeah, say there, Brent, remember our conversation about making mistakes and how the most important shot is the next one?\n\nHang on a second.\n\nYou guys agree with her?\n\nUnreal!\n\nI didn't ask to get yelled at by the PC police.\n\nYou know, I was gonna give you 10% off the cover price.\n\nBut now you're gonna have to pay the full 65 bucks like everybody else.\n\nThere's no money here.\n\nThe book event is cancelled because of these mean women.\n\n- [DRAMATIC MUSIC]\n\n\n\n- Oh Perhaps I can convince Simone to handle this the British way.\n\nSmile bravely, bury your feelings, and allow a steady drizzle to slowly wash away your sadness over 50 years.\n\nF that!\n\nSimone is not the problem.\n\nBrent is.\n\nHe needs to change, and walking on eggshells around him ain't gonna do the trick.\n\nWe need to throw the egg right at his face.\n\nYou're right.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nHe lived on Earth for almost 60 years.\n\nThis experiment is more than halfway over.\n\nHe's gotta improve, and we can't wait forever.\n\nJanet, where is he now?\n\nTake a wild guess.\n\n[SOFT MUSIC]\n\nHey, bud.\n\nWhat you up to?\n\n- Gripping and ripping?\n\n- Trying to.\n\nJust seems like the big dog don't wanna hunt today.\n\nSimone was very mean to me.\n\n- Maybe even a little r*cist.\n\n- Well, listen.\n\nArt is subjective.\n\nBut more importantly [EXHALES]\n\nNo other way to put this, buddy.\n\nYou made a mistake.\n\nYour actions hurt people.\n\nYou have to take responsibility for that.\n\nYou need to come back and apologize.\n\nTake the first step toward healing the neighborhood.\n\nFine, I'll be the bigger man.\n\nJust like my dad, when he single-handedly took on all those class-action lawsuits.\n\n[BRIGHT MUSIC]\n\nI just wish I could get through to the guy.\n\nI wonder if he'd respond to some Social Contract Theory.\n\nWhy are you trying to help him?\n\nHe doesn't even know you exist.\n\nHe doesn't see other people.\n\nI mean, he did call me a four-eyed coward who probably dry humps books.\n\nBut why not be a bigger person and rise above it?\n\nI'll tell you why.\n\nBecause doing that sends a message that it's okay to be treated this way.\n\nAnd it's not okay to treat anyone that way.\n\nNot Tahani, not me, not even you, Igby.\n\nEveryone, gather around, please.\n\nBrent has something that he'd like to say.\n\n[EXHALES]\n\nOkay.\n\nRegarding my critically-acclaimed novel, I am very sorry if you were offended.\n\nOkay?\n\n- Not an apology.\n\n- Yes, it was.\n\nOkay, fine.\n\nI'm sorry if what I wrote, which was perfectly okay, somehow made you feel like it wasn't okay.\n\nBut you know what?\n\nThat's on you.\n\nBrent.\n\nWrong direction, bud.\n\nNo, sorry, man.\n\nEither apologize for real or stop wasting our time.\n\nOkay, you know what?\n\nI'm actually not sorry at all.\n\nHow about that?\n\nIs that what you wanna hear?\n\nVery obviously not.\n\nYou know what?\n\nWhy don't we take a break?\n\nLet's all get a snack.\n\nNot until they give me the complos I rightly deserve.\n\nYou want a complo?\n\nI'll give you a complo.\n\nI didn't think it was possible to write a book as awful as yours.\n\nI literally didn't think human beings were capable of such r*cist, sexist poppycock!\n\nAlso, Chip Driver is either a private eye or the quarterback for the Chicago Bears, or the \"world's strongest president.\n\n\" He cannot be all three!\n\n[TENSE MUSIC]\n\nOh, boy.\n\nThis is a disgrace!\n\nI accomplished something.\n\nI wrote a novel, and now my integrity's being att*cked.\n\nI've been called r*cist, sexist.\n\nI don't have a r*cist or sexist bone in my body.\n\nI am Brent Norwalk, and I'm a good person.\n\nI'm in the Good Place.\n\nYou ever heard of it?\n\nAnd I'm here because I deserve to be here.\n\nI'm here because I earned it by being the best.\n\nYou're ridiculous.\n\nYeah, and you're a condescending bench.\n\nOh, uh, don't talk to her that way, please.\n\nHey, I have an idea.\n\nLet me summon a few philosophical works we can use to Oh, enough with the friggin' books, Igby.\n\nYeah, that's right.\n\nYou probably don't know this, but that character is based on you.\n\nNo, I I knew it, man.\n\n- Oh, look out.\n\n- Ah, I'm being att*cked again!\n\n- Sorry, that was unintentional - Fork you!\n\n[CLAMORING]\n\n[GROANS]\n\nSo I'm thinking bagel bites.\n\nFor the snack.\n\nMiddle-aged American male fragility.\n\nYou know why they're called baby boomers, right?\n\nBecause the tiniest little pinprick to their ego, and boom.\n\nThey become babies.\n\nI mean, that was it.\n\nWe were forked.\n\nSix months of painstaking work, trying to help the four humans overcome their worst instincts and bond as a group.\n\nAnd in a poof, it was gone.\n\nI told you, man.\n\nHumans suck.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nWell, this story has one more chapter.\n\n[TENSE MUSIC]\n\nSo today was bad.\n\nToday was very bad.\n\nEveryone, for sure, lost a bunch of points.\n\nAnd I don't have a solution.\n\nOkay, well, let's reset.\n\nI'll do something mildly iffy, and let John make a small, good decision to help.\n\nI could tell him I'm going to get ombre highlights and let him talk me out of it.\n\nWhat's wrong with ombre highlights?\n\nEleanor, please.\n\nThis week has been hard enough.\n\nI could set my robes on fire and try and get Brent to put it out.\n\nI know you're only suggesting that because you've repeatedly said you would look \"dope\" in flaming monk robes, but that's actually not a bad idea.\n\n\n\nForce him to help someone without actually thinking about it.\n\nMaybe I'll ask Chidi to lead a class on empathy.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay, let's write these down.\n\nWe got plenty of time left.\n\nWe can get back on track.\n\nThat was an hour ago.\n\nRight before I came here to see you for the last time.\n\nFor months, you and I have been debating.\n\nAre people good or bad?\n\nBut as I watched those three people pick themselves up and dust themselves off, I realized we've been asking the wrong question.\n\nWhat matters isn't if people are good or bad.\n\nWhat matters is if they're trying to be better today than they were yesterday.\n\nYou asked me where my hope comes from.\n\nThat's your answer.\n\n[WHIRRING]\n\n- What are you doing?\n\n- Sending you home.\n\nI'm not marbelizing you, Janet.\n\nI'm letting you go.\n\nI tried to win you over to our side, and it hasn't worked.\n\nSo keeping you as a prisoner just seems cruel.\n\nLetting you go home is how I've decided to be a little better today than I was yesterday.\n\n[SOFT MUSIC]\n\nHere's your phone.\n\nAnd a parting gift.\n\nOh, sweet, is that Brent's book?\n\nNo, I didn't have any cash on me, so I couldn't get you a copy.\n\nThis is a manifesto detailing everything that's happened with the humans.\n\nJanet and I wrote it a while back.\n\nShe's been updating it as we go.\n\n- I hope you'll read it.\n\n- Great thinking.\n\nPeople that get books as gifts always read them.\n\nBye!\n\n[AIR HISSES]\n    ]"},{number:7,title:"Help Is Other People",summary:"Eleanor Shellstrop arrives in the Good Place and meets her soulmate Chidi...",transcript:"[As you reach the end of your first year in the afterlife, what do you remember most?\n\nThe everlasting friendships you made?\n\nThe adversity you overcame together?\n\nThe day everything was chocolate?\n\nThat day was awesome.\n\nI had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.\n\nIt was all chocolate.\n\nShh, shh, shh.\n\nYou only have a few hours left in your first year, so why not do as many amazing good deeds for other people as you possibly can by midnight just in case?\n\nI know.\n\nI know.\n\nAll right, I'll take it out.\n\nI'm a little tired, okay?\n\n- Lay off.\n\n- That movie, minus the part where Eleanor gives away the entire experiment, will play before the party tonight.\n\nSpeaking of which, the theme is \"One Year Down, Infinity to Go.\n\n\" Dress is London black tie.\n\nThat means Knightsbridge black tie, not Kensington or, heaven forbid, West Brompton.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nCan you imagine?\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nNo.\n\nAlso, just after midnight, in order to reset my processing power, I will be violently eating my Janet babies.\n\nI'd advise no one look directly at me.\n\nCopy that.\n\nSo tonight at the party, we're gonna go for one more point grab.\n\nI'm gonna suggest that they make toasts about each other, celebrate their ups and downs, demonstrate personal growth, blah, blah, blah, humanity is saved.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nOne more day, guys.\n\nLet's finish strong.\n\nAnd to that end, as you might know, I've been practicing human magic.\n\nOh.\n\nTa-da.\n\n- Dope.\n\n- [LAUGHS]\n\nSo I was thinking No, the Magnificent Dr.\n\nPresto is not performing tonight.\n\n- Come on, I - Dude, magic is always lame.\n\nBut it's especially lame here, where there's actual magic.\n\nAs a counterargument, check your pocket.\n\n[WHIMSICAL MUSIC]\n\nThe other one.\n\nOh, sh**t, sorry.\n\nIt's my pocket.\n\nTa-da.\n\nDope.\n\nYou know what?\n\nYou can perform.\n\n- Really?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nYou changed my mind with that pocket thing.\n\nOh, boffo.\n\n- Oh, you're being mean.\n\n- Yep.\n\n[BRIGHT MUSIC]\n\nI am very excited for tonight.\n\nAnd dare I say, you all look so splendid, you could work the coat check at the Met Gala.\n\nOoh, speaking of the Met Gala, remember that security cam footage of Solange and Jay-Z fighting in the elevator?\n\nI learned to read lips.\n\nTurns out, she was yelling, \"No fair, I wanted to be the one to push the button.\n\n\" [LAUGHS]\n\nSo, uh, yeah, it wasn't as juicy as some people maybe thought it was.\n\n- [DOOR CLICKS OPEN]\n\n- Hey, g*ng.\n\nHad a pretty good round today.\n\nBetter close this door.\n\nI don't want all those birdies to follow me in here.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nWhy?\n\nOkay, Brent, hurry up and change so we can get to the party.\n\nOh, right, hang on.\n\nUh, Janet gave me this.\n\nTuxedo in a can.\n\n- [CAN POPS]\n\n- [GASPS]\n\nOoh, you know, I came this close to firing Janet, but she's gotten a lot better.\n\nOkay, we're not leaving yet.\n\nI need to show you all something.\n\n[DRAMATIC MUSIC]\n\nThis is the result of months of observation.\n\nNow, I know you're gonna think I'm crazy.\n\nNo, why would we think that?\n\nBut there is something wrong with this neighborhood.\n\nAnd it involves the people in this room.\n\nSo crazy that we're at the end of this thing and we have no idea how we did.\n\nJanet, any chance you could get a look inside that obelisk?\n\nCheck that magic scoreboard?\n\nThere is a chance, yes.\n\nAbout 1 in 970 trillion.\n\nLet's give her a whirl.\n\n- [SOFT BEEPS]\n\n- It did not work.\n\nI'll be right back.\n\n- [SOFT BEEP]\n\n- Ugh!\n\nI feel okay about most of it, but I just wish we had one concrete sign that Brent has improved.\n\nOne moment where he bumps into someone and sincerely says, \"Oops, my bad.\n\n\" You know?\n\nI would k*ll for an \"oops, my bad.\n\n\" Who's a girl gotta fork to get an \"oops, my bad\"?\n\nHey, hey, hey, panicking about this experiment at crucial moments is kind of my move.\n\n- Don't fall apart on me, now.\n\n- I won't.\n\nIt's just you know me.\n\nOn Earth, I never played a game unless I knew I could either win or bribe the ref so he'd throw it for me.\n\nAnd if we lose, I'm gonna be so mad.\n\n- Ugh!\n\n- Just one more day.\n\nWe're gonna stick to the plan, not do anything radical.\n\nThough we could do something [WHISPERING]\n\nAh, magical.\n\nYou gotta let it go, man.\n\n- [SOFT BEEP]\n\n- She's right.\n\nI've been suspicious about this place since day one.\n\nOver the last few months, I've been collecting data, and now I am positive, something is truly forked up.\n\nYou didn't tell me about any of this, muffin.\n\nOkay, you call her muffin?\n\nI'm getting a lot of breaking news at once here.\n\nI was gathering evidence.\n\nI didn't wanna compromise the integrity of the data collection.\n\nOh, so romantic.\n\nHere's what I know.\n\nEleanor and Michael are up to something, and it's focused on us.\n\nI mean, there are, like, 300 people in the neighborhood, and somehow they just spend all of their time talking to the six people in this room.\n\nWell, I mean, who else are they gonna talk to?\n\nDumb Shorts Cathy?\n\n- [LAUGHS]\n\n- What is your problem with her?\n\nI mean, shorts?\n\n\"Cathy\"?\n\nWhat isn't my problem with her?\n\nJianyu, are you okay?\n\nYou look sweaty.\n\nOh, no.\n\nHe's fine.\n\nHe always sweats when he's meditating.\n\nHe calls it \"sweat-itating.\n\n\" No, I mean, um, he doesn't talk, so I call it that.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nI'm friends with Sting.\n\nI can't take it anymore.\n\nI know something, and it's just graduated from hot goss to relevant AF.\n\nYes, I'm gonna.\n\nI'm gonna.\n\nThat's not Jianyu.\n\nHis name is Jason.\n\nAnd he's here by mistake.\n\nChidi's been helping him hide and become a better person.\n\n[EXHALES HEAVILY]\n\nI also knew about this, of course.\n\nMight as well come clean, darling.\n\nHi, Simone.\n\nJason Mendoza, Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nGo, Jags, obviously.\n\nUm, what else about me?\n\nI was born in a swimming pool.\n\nOkay, you never told me about this, ducky.\n\nDucky?\n\nI'm gonna have to sit down.\n\nThis is too much.\n\nWell, I swore I wouldn't tell, and keeping your word is a central tenet of deontological ethics.\n\nAw, so romantic.\n\nOkay, let's assume certain things are odd about this place.\n\nWhat is your theory?\n\nI don't know.\n\nMaybe this isn't the Good Place.\n\nMaybe it's a test.\n\nMy best guess, it's some kind of experiment.\n\nWe're being observed in a closed environment.\n\nSimone, look at this logically.\n\nWe are in paradise.\n\nThere's fresh air, mountains, Janet.\n\nAnd yes, some of us are under 5'10\", but other than that, it is literally perfect here.\n\nNo, it is not.\n\nJason is proof.\n\nAnd if you need more evidence that this isn't the Good Place, clearly he's not the only one who doesn't belong.\n\nActually, she's right, and I know it for a fact.\n\nFor the first time ever, I am desperate for you to keep talking.\n\nWell, right at the beginning, I talked to Mike and Eleanor, and they were like, \"Yeah, don't tell anyone this, \"but there's a place better than this, \"the Best Place, and that's where you're headed, amigo.\n\n\" I don't think they actually called you amigo.\n\nI had to go through the year here, kind of a test, I guess, which, obviously, I aced.\n\nSo at midnight, I'm in the first Escalade out of here, baby.\n\n- Brent.\n\n- Yeah?\n\n- Think about this.\n\n- Okay.\n\nHow could you get into the Best Place?\n\nYou would literally have to be one of the most incredible people in the universe.\n\nI mean, it makes sense to me.\n\nI don't know what to tell you.\n\n- [CHUCKLES]\n\n- Okay, in the words of Princess Kate after we came back from our shopping trip in Ibiza, \"There's a lot to unpack here.\n\n\" Perhaps we should just put our concerns aside and enjoy ourselves.\n\nNo way.\n\nWe have to figure out exactly what is going on here.\n\nOkay, just go to the party, but keep your eyes open.\n\nI've got a special mission for us.\n\n- Oh, I - Oh, good.\n\nMuffin and Ducky are on the case.\n\n- - [INDISTINCT CHATTER]\n\n- How's it going?\n\n- Awesome.\n\nNo, it isn't.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nTerrible.\n\nSimone knows the neighborhood isn't what it appears to be.\n\nShe's been collecting evidence for months.\n\nSo all that hanging out with Brent and participating in group activities Was under false pretenses.\n\nShe was observing him.\n\nShe's been observing everything.\n\nGuys, pick a card.\n\n- Yes!\n\n- No time.\n\nThe subjects are onto us.\n\nThey know something weird is going on, and it could derail the entire experiment.\n\n- Oh, no!\n\n- [COINS JINGLING]\n\nOh, sorry, uh, that was unintentional.\n\nWhat?\n\nThere's nothing here.\n\nDid you find anything?\n\nJust some song lyrics that Michael wrote?\n\n\"Here's a trippy little ditty 'bout a train to Groovy City.\n\n\"Open up your freaky crystal mind and we'll have a cosmic good time.\n\n\" See, that makes me think we're in hell.\n\nLook, we tried to prove your theory, but it feels like we came up empty.\n\nChidi, there is so much evidence they've been lying.\n\nHow can you not see that?\n\nEleanor told me that this was her first neighborhood.\n\nMaybe some of these are just honest mistakes.\n\nAnd also she told me some other stuff that I really want to be true.\n\nWhat kind of stuff?\n\nWell, it was something about us.\n\nWhy does everything I do fall apart so close to the end?\n\nMy first experiment, now this experiment.\n\nI only got halfway through writing \"The Purple Train to Groovy City.\n\n\" I just ran out of creative juice.\n\nFocus.\n\nWe cannot let this slip away from us at the last second.\n\nNew plan: forget the toasts.\n\nWe do nothing.\n\nWe hope that our early successes make up for the embarrassing mess we've become.\n\nLike Facebook or America.\n\nOkay, sound good?\n\nMichael?\n\nWe have no way to know what this really means for the experiment.\n\nI don't think we can play it safe.\n\nI have a plan.\n\nIt's risky.\n\nBut it might be the only way to get them to where they need to be.\n\nDo you trust me?\n\nYeah.\n\nFork it.\n\nWhatever it is, I'm in.\n\nI'm always down for forking it.\n\n- We trust you Michael.\n\n- Then trust the Magnificent Dr.\n\nPresto.\n\nMan, you cannot pull that hat out after you ask us if we trust you.\n\nSoul mates?\n\nThat's what Eleanor said, that we're soul mates?\n\nYep.\n\nPretty neat, huh?\n\nI think it's pretty neat.\n\nDo you think it's pretty neat, intensely, forever?\n\nChidi, I really like you.\n\nBut I don't think we're soul mates.\n\nBecause I don't think soul mates actually exist.\n\nRight.\n\nRight, right.\n\n- Right?\n\n- Think rationally.\n\nIsn't it weird that she only told one of us that we're soul mates?\n\nIs it odd?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes it mean that Eleanor's motives are questionable?\n\nAlso yes.\n\nBut does it suggest that she wasn't being truthful?\n\nYes.\n\nOkay, I'm starting to see your point.\n\nWhoa.\n\n[WHIMSICAL MUSIC]\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nWhy is it only four of us?\n\nWhy not Tahani and Jason?\n\nWhy are there emojis?\n\nI mean, one of them's party hat guy.\n\nI mean, that's good, right?\n\nHe's friendly.\n\nIt's better than thermometer guy or angry cat or smiling poop coil.\n\nOkay, we have to get back to the party before Eleanor and Michael notice we're missing.\n\nGreat plan.\n\nLet's kiss.\n\nSorry, still thinking about the soul mate thing.\n\n- Let's go.\n\n- Okay.\n\nLadies and gentlemen I can't believe I'm saying this the Magnificent Dr.\n\nPresto.\n\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n\nThank you.\n\nNow, I know some of you may not believe in magic.\n\nWell, I think they believe in some magic.\n\nYesterday everybody ate a lollipop that let them talk to birds.\n\n- [APPLAUSE]\n\n- Okay, but this is Earth magic.\n\nAnd it's harder.\n\nAnd if you don't understand that, I am here to change your mind.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nOh, come on.\n\nIt started out as a dollar bill and now it's four quarters.\n\n\"Change your mind\"?\n\n- Michael, it's three quarters.\n\n- What?\n\nOh, three quarters.\n\nThree quarters, even harder!\n\n- Thank you!\n\n- [TEPID APPLAUSE]\n\nCan you make them clap harder?\n\nThey see what they see, man.\n\nDid you guys find anything?\n\nYes, proof that the four of us and only the four of us are being forked with.\n\nBut we still don't have any hard proof that this place is evil or that Michael and Eleanor are nefarious, so, you know, no one's heart needs to break just yet.\n\nYeah, I'm with him.\n\nThis place is fine.\n\nHey, if you guys don't make the cut up to the Best Place, I'll try to put in a good word for you.\n\n- You guys got business cards?\n\n- Brent, I need a volunteer.\n\nCome on up.\n\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n\nOkay, Brent, I want you to take off your wristwatch and place it in my hat.\n\nNow, this is a Rolex.\n\nIt's the exact same\xa0\xa0watch\xa0Richie Sambora wears.\n\n- Ah.\n\n- So be careful.\n\nAnd now the Magnificent Dr.\n\nPresto will transform y - Oh.\n\nOh.\n\n- [GROUND RUMBLING]\n\n[PEOPLE GASPING AND YELLING]\n\n- Oh, my gosh!\n\n- Whoa!\n\nOh!\n\n- No, oh, Brent!\n\n- [SCREAMS]\n\n[PEOPLE YELLING]\n\nBrent, can you hear me?\n\nIf it somehow helps, there's a small dove in your pocket!\n\nNever mind.\n\nBrent, I'm so sorry.\n\nI must have screwed up the trick somehow.\n\nHold on, we're gonna get you out of there.\n\nYeah, you better!\n\nI got a hell of a lawsuit on my hands.\n\nI'm gonna frickin' own this place.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Okay, everyone, uh, please disperse.\n\nWe'll let you know when it's safe.\n\nUh, you three, stay here.\n\nKeep an eye on Brent.\n\nWe're gonna try and fix this remotely using eternal-being technology.\n\nTahani, Jianyu, try and find a rope.\n\n- Righto.\n\n- Okay, so what do we do, try to climb down or wait for the rope?\n\n\n\nNeither, we get the fork outta here.\n\nChidi, a giant hell-hole just opened up and swallowed one of us.\n\nI don't care what this place really is.\n\nGiant holes are bad, and we should go.\n\nOr giant holes are bad, so if someone falls into one, you try to help get him out.\n\n- Whoa.\n\n- [SCREAMS]\n\nI'm not scared!\n\nI'm shouting so you know I'm okay.\n\nI am very brave.\n\nWhoo, I hope this works.\n\nWe basically just confirmed that we're lying to them.\n\nOh, man.\n\nWas this a bad idea?\n\nI mean, what if this was a bad idea?\n\nIt wasn't, homey.\n\nIt was a good idea.\n\nCan anyone else weigh in?\n\nI'm serious.\n\nIn football, trying to run out the clock and hoping for the best never works.\n\nIt's called \"prevent defense.\n\n\" You don't take any chances and just try and hang on to your lead.\n\nBut prevent defense just prevents you from winning.\n\nIt's always better to try something.\n\nJason, that was coherent.\n\nOh, sorry, I didn't mean to.\n\nIt's a good plan, Michael.\n\nHopefully they've bonded enough as a group to rescue Brent, call me, get a train, and all head out of here together.\n\nBut was it a mistake to have Brent fall in?\n\nWe could have had Chidi fall in, right?\n\nOr a cute baby panda or maybe, you know, like, a box of doughnuts?\n\nEveryone loves doughnuts.\n\nBrent was the right choice.\n\nIt's not a tough call whether to save Chidi because he's a brilliant and kind person with a caboose you can bounce a quarter off of, and I know because I've done it.\n\nWe threw Brent in there because there is no reason any of them should help him because Brent sucks.\n\nBrent is the opposite of a box of doughnuts.\n\nToilet full of broccoli.\n\nYeah, kinda, Brent is a toilet full of broccoli.\n\nBut because he sucks so bad, if they do risk their safety to help him, they'll get more points.\n\nBasically it's a Hail Mary.\n\nIt's risky, but if we complete it, we win the game.\n\nThat was two good analogies in a row.\n\nI'm now worried that he's a demon in a Jason suit.\n\nAre we really in hell?\n\nI mean, I didn't lead a perfect life on Earth, but I worked very hard.\n\nMaking fun of people you'd never even met.\n\nWell, I guess you must be right, Simone, because you always have to be.\n\nHey, are you the bottom of a coal-fired pizza?\n\n- Why, 'cause I'm burnt?\n\n- Gah!\n\nYou are always right.\n\nWell, if it is hell, I know why I'm here.\n\nAlmond milk.\n\nI drank so much of it despite the negative environmental impacts.\n\nOkay, wherever we are, I do not wanna be here when the clock hits zero, okay?\n\nNow might be our only chance to escape.\n\nNot without Brent.\n\nDo you think if the roles were reversed, he would waste any time rescuing you?\n\nMaybe.\n\nIf Elle Macpherson were nearby and he wanted to impress her or if he thought that I was a prince he could ransom That's not the point.\n\nHe is a person in a hole.\n\nI have a duty to help him get out.\n\nWhat he would do is irrelevant.\n\nI don't think it is.\n\nIf you do a science experiment a thousand times and always get the same results, you move on.\n\nWe've given Brent a thousand chances to be a good person.\n\n\n\nIn one of them, he was so awful, you punched him in the face.\n\n\n\nOkay, but when I did that, I thought cutting him out of our group meant that he would have to find another place in heaven to hang out.\n\nThat's changed.\n\nI can't just leave him.\n\n[SOLEMN MUSIC]\n\nWell, I respect your position.\n\nI respect yours.\n\nLook, I know everything's really scary right now, but I just have to say it.\n\nThat was the most boring breakup I've ever seen.\n\n[CAR ENGINE TURNING OVER]\n\nHey, Chidi, shake it off.\n\nAnother bus comes every 15 minutes.\n\nBrent.\n\n[QUIRKY MUSIC]\n\nWhere are they?\n\nThey never called a train.\n\nThey must have taken Brent's Escalade.\n\nOh, that's good.\n\nThe important thing is that the group bonded and stayed together.\n\nHello!\n\nCould someone help us?\n\n- Us?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nThis frickin' genius tried to help me and he fell in.\n\nI thought you were smart, man.\n\nAre you serious right now?\n\nWell, turns out, the group did not bond.\n\nThe group snapped in half.\n\nWill you help us?\n\nThese rocks are really sharp down here.\n\n- I'm scared.\n\n- I'm not.\n\n- Just give us a second.\n\n- Guys, I think we're cooked.\n\nIt's over.\n\nNo, no way.\n\nI am not giving up.\n\nI told you, I only play games I can win.\n\nAnd I played this game, so that means we can win.\n\n- I don't think that tracks.\n\n- Shut up.\n\nWhat do you know?\n\nLiterally everything, but keep going.\n\nI am liking this energy from you.\n\nWe have eight minutes left, so that means we keep trying.\n\nWhat else can we try?\n\nWe've already blown everything up.\n\nWe can't blow it up again.\n\nIf there's one thing I know in this world, it's that you can always blow up the same thing twice.\n\nHe's right.\n\nWe have one last move here.\n\nGuys, we are so sorry about your ordeal.\n\nWe just have a few questions for you.\n\nUh, where are John and Simone?\n\nWe can't find them.\n\nThey left.\n\n- I don't know where they went.\n\n- Typical.\n\nDisloyal jerks.\n\nYou know, man, actually, they really tried with you and you made it very hard to be your friend.\n\nYou wanna know what happened?\n\nThey got jealous because I'm going to the Best Place.\n\n- They bugged out.\n\n- You're not going to the Best Place!\n\nDon't you get it?\n\nThey're torturing you.\n\nThey're torturing all of us!\n\n[SCOFFS]\n\nBecause this is the Bad Place.\n\n[DRAMATIC MUSIC]\n\n[BOTH CACKLING]\n\nOh, man!\n\nI can't believe you figured it out!\n\nWait.\n\nHe's right?\n\nThis is the Bad Place?\n\nYeah.\n\nDamn it, he's right.\n\nYeah, we had a good run, though, didn't we?\n\n- Yeah, we did.\n\n- [BOTH LAUGH]\n\nSo no Best Place?\n\n[MOCKINGLY]\n\n\"Oh, so no Best Place?\" Oh, Brent, you big white oaf.\n\nNever change, bud.\n\nWell, I guess we should let him know you guys are on your way.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Wait.\n\nOn our way where?\n\nThe actual Bad Place.\n\nThey let us toy with you a little just for kicks, but now you're going [SQUEAKS]\n\n- [LAUGHS]\n\n- And trust me on this.\n\nIt's a lot worse.\n\n[BOTH CACKLING]\n\n- Well done.\n\n- Let's hope it works.\n\nWe only have a minute left.\n\nMan, crazy twist, huh?\n\nIt's like something out of a Chip Driver novel.\n\nLeave me alone, Brent.\n\nI'm kind of freaking out over here, man.\n\nYou're my only real friend.\n\nI'm not your friend.\n\nI don't even like you.\n\n- But you helped me.\n\n- Yeah, I did.\n\nBecause I have this stupid moral code that forces me to help everyone.\n\nBut you have never helped anyone because you don't care about other people, which is the bare minimum that a person has to do, just care a little about the other people around you, and you can't do it.\n\nWhat are you trying to say here?\n\nYou are a bad person.\n\nYou can do this.\n\nCome on,

guys.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nWhat's up?\n\nTell us what happened.\n\nDid we win, did we lose?\n\nIs humanity saved forever?\n\nAnd did you find Nintendo?\n\nI can't find it any whoop.\n\nNever mind.\n\nI'm holding it.\n\nSorry, I can't reveal the results of the experiment until we get to the Judge's chambers.\n\nOkay, where is everyone?\n\nWhere's Simone and John and Brent and actually I don't care about any of those doofs.\n\n- Where's Chidi?\n\n- Oh, he's on the toilet.\n\nSorry, that's not enough information.\n\nThe text subjects are frozen in stasis, so I put them in the bathroom, and I placed Chidi on the toilet, the best seat.\n\nLet's wake him up.\n\nYou know, so I can, like, be reunited with the man I love.\n\nSnappy, snappy, memory fixy.\n\nThe Judge says no one gets unfrozen until she's ruled on the case.\n\nOh, humans have to stay here.\n\n- You can't see the numbers.\n\n- Hang on.\n\nI worked my ash off running this neighborhood for a full year, and I'm not even allowed to hear how we did?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd here's a bottle of tequila.\n\nOkay, let us know how it goes.\n\n[WHIMSICAL MUSIC]\n\nRegardless of what the Judge rules, this feels like some sort of good-bye.\n\nEven if we succeeded, there's no guarantee she'll keep us together.\n\n\n\nShe might just snap her fingers and send us flying into different dimensions.\n\nHow was that?\n\nDid I cheer everyone up?\n\nAw, man, are we gonna die again?\n\nWe've died so many times.\n\nWe've probably had, like, 15 funerals by now.\n\nIt's getting annoying.\n\nIf it would cheer you up, I could tell you what happened at your original funerals.\n\nTahani, Moby spoke first.\n\nHe claimed that Uh, please stop.\n\nI don't want to hear it.\n\nwhat about mine?\n\nYour friends didn't say things about you so much as they graffitied a Red Lobster about you.\n\nYeah, in Jacksonville, that's the first stage of grief.\n\n\n\nIn Arizona, you can either have a regular funeral, or they can put your body out on a sh**ting range, and you get a $200 state tax credit.\n\nHang on.\n\nThis is how we take our minds off the Judge's ruling.\n\nLet's throw ourselves the funeral to end all funerals.\n\nAwesome.\n\nAnd you know what they say in Florida: \"If you don't like this funeral, just wait a minute.\n\n\" [WHOOSHING]\n\nUgh.\n\nThe Judge's chambers.\n\nI hate this place.\n\nWhat's the wi-fi password?\n\nThere is no service.\n\nShawn.\n\nMichael.\n\nBounces of me, and sticks to you.\n\nWait.\n\nNo, I messed that up.\n\nFirst, say something mean to me, really cruel, something that just guts me.\n\nYou're totally gonna be glue.\n\nSo it's come to this.\n\nWe have finally arrived at the end of your pathetic attempt to prove that humans are more than just mobile turd factories, and you are going to fail again because that is what you do.\n\nYou're a choker, Michael.\n\nAnd you're about to choke for the last time except for the eternity you're going to spend in the Bad Place being choked by me, who will be doing the choking.\n\nWell, you're glue.\n\n- Wow.\n\n- [GASPS]\n\n- Look at this place.\n\n- Beautiful.\n\nThe floor.\n\nHello, Good Place committee.\n\nThank you for coming.\n\nNo, thank you, Michael.\n\nYou did an incredible job, maybe the best job that anyone's ever done at any task.\n\nBut you don't know how we did.\n\nWe might not know how you did, but we know you did great.\n\nAnd Shawn, before we even find out what happened, we want you to know we're willing to give up all our leverage, compromise, and meet you halfway.\n\nI met your mom halfway last night.\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\n- So colorful!\n\nWe are here to celebrate the afterlife of Tahani Al-Jamil, in the place she felt most comfortable, the cabin of a Gulfstream G650 private jet.\n\nTahani was super nice, and she deserved for people to be nicer to her than they were.\n\nThe only sad thing is that she never got over her speech impediment.\n\n\n\nTahani improved so much over her many lives, but she also helped me improve.\n\nShe taught me lots of stuff, like bras shouldn't be painful, and you don't buy bras at Home Depot, and they don't sell bras at Home Depot.\n\nWhat the hell are you wearing?\n\nFor the record, it was a men's back support harness, and it worked in a pinch.\n\nShe was the best friend I ever had and I loved her.\n\nOh, thank you so much.\n\nThat was wonderful.\n\nI wish Chidi was here.\n\nIt sucks that he's too dead for these Heaven funerals.\n\nCan someone grab his arm?\n\nMy hands are kind of full with his butt.\n\nHow'd he get so jacked?\n\nWhen he was 14, someone told him that exercise alleviated anxiety, and he started doing pushups and basically never stopped.\n\n[ALL GRUNTING]\n\nAll right, everyone.\n\nLet's get this done.\n\nThis is the single most important case that has ever appeared in my court, and the results will have ramifications for eternity.\n\nBefore we begin, I'm going to need you all to sign this.\n\nA petition to bring back \"Ally McBeal.\n\n\" Well, yeah.\n\nI mean, everything else is getting rebooted.\n\nGet a young hottie in there, you know, like a Zendaya type.\n\nIs it Zendaya or Zendaya?\n\nZendaya.\n\nOr I don't I

the future of humanity.\n\nHere we go.\n\nIn 30, 29 - [CLEARS THROAT]\n\n- Two, one.\n\nVoil\xc3 .\n\n[SLOT MACHINE SOUND EFFECTS]\n\nI thought this would be fun.\n\nHad a lot of time alone in there.\n\n[BELL CHIMES]\n\nBam!\n\nSimone got 12% better than she was on Earth.\n\nBam!\n\nChidi got 26% better.\n\nBam!\n\nJohn got 44% better.\n\n[SAD HORN]\n\nsh**t.\n\nShouldn't have committed so hard to this \"bam\" thing.\n\nFuneral!\n\nJason, at the risk of getting an answer that might thoroughly depress me, what made you choose this setting?\n\nThere's a Jacksonville tradition of having your funeral where you were born.\n\nI got born in the deep end of a pool right after my mom did a cannonball.\n\nWell, I knew the risks.\n\nYou never really talk about your mom.\n\nYeah, she died when I was pretty young.\n\nI lost her to the big C.\n\nThat's what we called the crocodile that lived by my house.\n\nI'm just playing.\n\nIt was cancer.\n\n\xa0Watch\xa0me do a handstand.\n\nJason Mendoza didn't have an easy life.\n\nHe once told me the closest he'd ever gotten to having a pi\xc3\xb1ata on his birthday was when a seagull ate too many condoms on the beach and exploded.\n\nBut despite it all, he was the most optimistic person I'd ever met.\n\nJason was the very first person to ask me about my feelings.\n\nI hadn't had any yet, but it made me want to go get some.\n\nI could see something special inside him that no one else could see.\n\nIt was a multi-colored blob of positivity right behind his sternum.\n\nThat's my Jason, a big, colorful, rainbow blob stuffed inside a hot, life-size action figure.\n\nPlus, I gotta say it was nice to have a true dirtbag buddy so I could talk about what really mattered in life.\n\nWrestling, semi-legal dr*gs, and Jason Statham.\n\nStatham forever!\n\nIndeed.\n\nStatham forever.\n\nAmen.\n\nAmen.\n\nLet's focus on the big picture here.\n\nFree of Earth's complications and its unintended consequences, the other three improved a lot.\n\nChidi got 38% more confident.\n\nSimone got 43% more flexible in her judgments of people, and John didn't call one single person the C-word.\n\nBut he did yell the C-word at himself as well as a pack of squirrels and a chair he tripped over.\n\nWhy are we even still discussing this?\n\nBrent got worse.\n\nIf humans can't be good with their needs magically met, maybe they're just not that good.\n\nHe's right; the evidence needed to be overwhelming.\n\nI can't just turn the whole afterlife upside down because three people got a little bit better.\n\nBut don't forget.\n\nThere's a lot of evidence that Eleanor, Jason and Tahani got better in the original experiment, so that's six people.\n\nThat's the number of friends in \"Friends.\n\n\" Are you gonna sit there and say that every single Friend belongs in hell?\n\nI mean, maybe Ross and Rachel, and Monica and Joey, and definitely Chandler but Phoebe?\n\nFace it, Michael.\n\nYou lost.\n\nEverything you've done, this experiment, the original Neighborhood, sending your little cockroach buddies back to Earth, all of it was for nothing.\n\nBam.\n\nYou're glue.\n\nActually, Shawn, that's a very interesting point.\n\nExactly.\n\nWhat?\n\nMatt, call up the active files of four people still alive on Earth, Kamilah Al-Jamil, Donna Shellstrop, and her stepdaughter Patricia, and Steven Peleaz, AKA Pillboi.\n\nThey were not part of the experiment.\n\nIf he gets to bring in random good people into it, I should be able to bring in random bad people.\n\nCall up Elizabeth Holmes.\n\nNo, Henry Kissinger.\n\nNo PewDiePie.\n\nYour honor, the people I want to look at are not random.\n\nThey're four humans the cockroaches helped on Earth.\n\nNo magic.\n\nJust just kindness.\n\nAnd I bet their emotional support made those four people better.\n\nAnd I'm wrong, I'll be the first to say we're glue.\n\n\n\nI don't think any of you is using that right, but, fine, let's see it.\n\nLook.\n\nRight there.\n\nAfter we intervened, Pillboi dedicated himself to caring for the elderly.\n\nKamilah started a scholarship in Tahani's name that sent 213 women to college.\n\nDonna started doing homework with Patricia every night, and that little girl actually ended up teaching Donna multiplication.\n\nYikes.\n\nLook, the point is people improve when they get external love and support.\n\nHow can we hold it against them when they don't?\n\nNeed I remind you that Brent got worse with every second of every moment of every day.\n\nUntil right at the end.\n\nWith 10 seconds left, he swung way up.\n\nThis is it, your honor.\n\nThis is the whole story.\n\nNo one is beyond rehabilitation.\n\nBrent spent a year being an absolute diaper load of a human being, and the points total tells you that.\n\nBut what that number can't tell you is who he could've become tomorrow.\n\nI'll have my ruling shortly.\n\nOkay, Janet, where do you want to go for your funeral?\n\nDave and Buster's, probably?\n\nYou probably want to go to Dave and Buster's.\n\nI think I heard her say Dave and Buster's, so let's just go there.\n\nWe can sort it out later.\n\nIt's nice that you want to honor me, but you've already given me so much.\n\nTahani taught me that you can make a family, even if you never really had one.\n\nJason taught me I have value beyond what I do for other people.\n\nAnd Eleanor there was a moment on Earth when all hope was lost, and I watched you have hope anyway.\n\nJust thinking about that makes me want to barf up a beautiful quasar.\n\nWell said, Janet.\n\nThat means it's your turn, Eleanor.\n\nAll right.\n\nMine's easy.\n\nWe don't even have to move.\n\nI stand here before you, in sweatpants for the first time ever, to celebrate Eleanor Shellstrop in a place where she spent much of her life, a bar in a house she was not invited to.\n\nEleanor was full of surprises.\n\nI never knew if she was going to ruthlessly make fun of me, or totally objectify me in a way that was flattering, and also vaguely problematic.\n\n- Well - But whether she was lifting me up or calling me out I never felt quite so seen as when she saw me.\n\nEleanor, I know you don't like it when people get all emotional about you, so I channeled all of my love for you into this song.\n\n[DISCORDANT VOCALIZING]\n\nThat's when the foam cannons go pshh!\n\nExplode outward!\n\nAnd then back to the song.\n\n[VOCALIZING]\n\nOkay, okay, we're good.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nOkay, who's left?\n\nWe are here to celebrate the afterlife of Chidi Anagonye.\n\nEleanor, would you like to say a few words?\n\nChidi was a rootin', tootin', rackin' frackin' varmint.\n\nSorry, I don't know why I just went full Yosemite Sam, there.\n\nUm yeah, I don't think I can do this.\n\nI I can't just sum up all of my feelings about Chidi, so I'm gonna pass.\n\nThe Judge is about to make her ruling.\n\nShe wants us to be there to hear it.\n\nOh, we should probably change outfits.\n\nTahani's sweatpants say \"skank army\" on the butt.\n\nThey do?\n\nMichael you came to me and said the points system was flawed, a system that has been in place since the dawn of time and has judged every soul that has ever walked the earth.\n\nAnd I have come to the conclusion that you're right.\n\n- I'm - You're right.\n\nHumans are not fixed at one level of morality.\n\nThey can always get better, which means the points system does not accurately judge how good or bad they are.\n\nYou won.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\n\n\n[INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC]\n\nWell that wasn't so hard now, what it?\n\n- [CHEERS, LAUGHTER]\n\n- We did it!\n\nWe did it!\n\nThe universe owes you a debt of gratitude for bringing this to my attention.\n\nNow, in terms of how we handle this moving forward, obviously, Earth is cancelled.\n\nBuhh Earth is what, now?\n\nAll humans on Earth and in the afterlife will be extinguished, and we will start the entire human race over from scratch.\n\nAnd you know what's so funny?\n\nIn a very roundabout way, I am actually rebooting \"Ally McBeal\" because I'm rebooting everything.\n\nAnyway, congrats, Michael.\n\nYou won.\n\nWhoa, whoa, your honor.\n\nLet's just slow down here, and say everything again maybe, because I think some of us were thinking about skateboards and don't know what's going on.\n\nCanceling Earth but doesn't seem a bit drastic?\n\nIt's just too much of a mess down there, you know?\n\nI mean, the simplest solution is to erase everyone that ever lived and restart with a bunch of amoebas or whatever.\n\nThen human life will evolve again, or maybe even something better.\n\n\n\nMaybe this time they won't have baby teeth, you know?\n\nThat whole thing is so weird, like they fall out and then the bigger teeth just grow out of that same hole.\n\nGross.\n\nAnyway, the important thing is Earth [RASPBERRY]\n\nHow are you guys surprised?\n\nI mean, what did you think was gonna happen if you won?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI thought we could just give, like, give three points for eating an apple instead of two.\n\nYes, why can't we just tweak the points a little?\n\nJust, you know, a little boost, like Spanx, but for your soul.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Guys, the problem isn't the points.\n\nIt's that Earth has become too complicated for the points to reflect the value of human behavior.\n\nRemember?\n\nThe whole thing you discovered?\n\nAnd now I have no choice but to fix it.\n\nWhere did I put that human wiper outer thingy?\n\nLip gloss, lip gloss, thing that ends all the wars, \"Justified\" season two.\n\nWow, you won.\n\nAnd you still somehow failed.\n\nClassic.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nWake Chidi up.\n\nNow.\n\nWe need all the help we can get.\n\nYou really want me to wake him up, just to tell him that he and everyone else in the universe is going

both take you.\n\nIt worked?\n\nPerfectly.\n\nThey're happy again, Uzo.\n\nThey're even talking about getting me a puppy.\n\nBut more importantly, I proved once and for all that you can always find the answer.\n\n- The answer to what?\n\n- To anything.\n\nEvery problem has an answer.\n\nIf you just read enough books and think hard enough, you can figure out the answer to any question.\n\nI know you're really smart, but that sounds wrong.\n\nChildren, please take your seats.\n\nHere's a perfect example.\n\nWhere to sit?\n\nWhat's the answer?\n\nObviously, we want to be back by the pencil

this is enough cheese.\n\nThere's sheep, goat, and cow's milk.\n\n- I can run and get more.\n\n- Oh, no.\n\nThis is plenty of cheese.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nI have to ask, has Chidi always been so thoughtful?\n\nEver since he was a child.\n\nI'm sure you've heard about his first great lecture.\n\nOh, no.\n\nNot that old story again.\n\nIt's so embarrassing.\n\nOh, go ahead.\n\nA long time ago, Emeka and I were going through a rough patch, and our little Chidi, at eight years old, comes in with a one-hour lecture.\n\nAll about why we should stay married, and all these years later, here we still are.\n\n- It's the reason I got into philosophy.\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\nThe biggest questions and the biggest answers, you just gotta find them.\n\nI mean, I love philosophy, too, but I'd argue that, say, theoretical physics presents bigger questions than philosophy.\n\nOh [LAUGHING]\n\nDo you really think that?\n\nShould I switch to physics?\n\n[LIGHT MUSIC]\n\nSo obviously my parents loved you.\n\nI'm so glad.\n\nThey're great.\n\nWe have to break up.\n\nUh, [STAMMERS]\n\nwait.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhy?\n\nI've been feeling this way for a while now.\n\nIt's just why are we together?\n\nBecause it it makes sense.\n\nI mean, you like Kant.\n\nI like Kant.\n\nWe're not a book group.\n\nI mean, but we're not not a book group.\n\nOkay, if there's a problem with our relationship, there is an answer that will solve it.\n\n- So, let's hit the library.\n\n- You wanna use philosophy?\n\nHow about David Hume?\n\n\"Reason is and ought only to be a sl*ve to the passions.\n\n\" You know, emotions, desires, feelings.\n\n- Do you have any of those?\n\n- Of course I have feelings.\n\nI I have strong feelings for for you and and what we have, and right now, I will show you How Kant refuted most of Hume's central theses.\n\n- Oh, my God.\n\n- He [DOOR CLICKS OPEN]\n\n[DISPOSAL CHURNING]\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nI think it's 3,600 pages.\n\nI have a job, Chidi.\n\nI have a family.\n\nUntil I had to read this, I had a will to live.\n\nThis work is an insane, tangled web of inscrutability.\n\nIn the fun, \"grad students will analyze this for centuries\" way?\n\nNo, in the Unabomber way.\n\nOkay, well, um, I'll write my way out of the maze.\n\nI'll re-outline the middle chapters, - do more research - No, Chidi.\n\nYou can't answer every question every philosopher has ever asked, so what in these pages do you care about?\n\n- All of it.\n\nEqually.\n\n- Shut up.\n\n- But - Shut up, shut up.\n\n- Should I - Shut up, shut up.\n\nThe greatest works of modern philosophy are emotional.\n\nThey make an argument about how the world is and ought to be.\n\n\n\nThere is a great mind at work in here, but where is the heart?\n\nWhere are the guts?\n\nI understand.\n\nI do.\n\nSo I'm going to go home and compose a short paper for you, arguing that I should continue working on this longer paper.\n\nShut up!\n\nWow, tough week.\n\nSorry, pal.\n\nI mean, honestly, I don't know what hurts more; my thesis meeting or Allesandra.\n\n[EXHALES]\n\nShe was brilliant and and funny.\n\nI thought that maybe she was the answer.\n\nSome things in life don't have an answer.\n\nIsn't that what Allesandra was saying?\n\nIsn't that what your advisor said, too?\n\nIsn't that what everyone who knows you has said to you at every waking moment of your life?\n\nOkay, I can figure this out.\n\nI just need to find the answer for how to impress Allesandra, a separate answer for how to impress my advisor, or ideally, one answer for how to impress them both.\n\nOh, you know what this calls for.\n\n- Don't say it.\n\n- A Venn diagram.\n\nNo Venn diagram.\n\nIf you won't listen to other people, do you at least hear what you're saying?\n\nI swear, sometimes it is literally impossible to be your friend.\n\nYou're incapable of making a single decision.\n\nLook, what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes - to find the perfect - [GLASS

make a decision this big?\n\nChidi, here's the thing with stuff.\n\nYou can look at a problem from every angle and drive yourself crazy, but sometimes, you just gotta huck a Molotov cocktail at a drone and see what happens.\n\nIs what happens that the drone blows up?\n\nUsually.\n\nI mean, where I'm from, most things blow up eventually, so I learned that when something dope comes along, you gotta lock it down.\n\nIf you're always frozen in fear and taking too long to think about what to do, you'll miss your opportunity and maybe get sucked into the propeller of a swamp boat.\n\nI just I don't think I'll ever be the kind of person who just acts.\n\n\n\nI mean, I can't just open a door and walk through without knowing what's on the other side.\n\nEven with eternity to try, - I just don't think that can happen.\n\n- [CHIMES]\n\nWell, I never thought I'd ever be able to get married.\n\nI thought I was too old.\n\nI'm infinity, but strange things happen in the afterlife.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\n[SLOW-MOTION, TENSE MUSIC]\n\nWe figured it out once.\n\nWe can do it again, because you know what, Michael?\n\nYou're basic This is your soul mate, Salamasina.\n\nMeet

reading the cards off the reflection in my glasses, but yeah, that was amazing.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nUm, can I ask you something?\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\n- Tonight could have been a real disaster.\n\nHow do you have the confidence to just swoop in and so elegantly take charge of a whole group of strangers?\n\nHonestly, the confidence comes from failure.\n\nI've thrown my fair share of disastrous gatherings.\n\nRemind me to tell you someday about Timoth\xc3\xa9e Chalamet's bar mitzvah.\n\n\n\nBut you live through the failure and you learn from it.\n\nYeah, I just I can't operate that way.\n\nI can't make a decision unless I'm sure I'm right.\n\nHey, Chidi, you're a philosophy professor, right?\n\nAny chance you'd wanna grab a drink and talk about ethics?\n\nIt's a subject I've recently needed - to learn about immediately.\n\n- Sounds great.\n\n- Uh, let me get my coat.\n\n- Awesome.\n\nBy the way, I wasn't cheating before.\n\nOr eavesdropping just now.\n\nWhoo!\n\nWhen we started three months ago, I never thought I'd get so into philosophy - that we'd study past midnight.\n\n- [CHUCKLES]\n\nEsmerelda must be wondering where her soul mate is.\n\nAh, no, she's off in her aviary.\n\nSometimes I think her ravens are her real soul mate.\n\n- [BOTH LAUGHING]\n\n- I'm not kidding.\n\nActually, you should see her with them.\n\nIt's intense, and if I'm being honest, sexually charged.\n\nAnyways, um, this has been fun as alway [EXHALES]\n\nUh, what was why did you Who was it?\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nOkay.\n\nI'll take those one at a time, I guess.\n\nUm, it was a kiss, I did it because I wanted to, and as far as who it was, it was me, weirdo.\n\nEleanor, I I have a soul mate.\n\nYeah, and you're not into her at all.\n\nI mean, come on.\n\nThere is no way you're supposed to spend eternity with a woman who sleeps in a giant nest.\n\nLook, I I know she and I are in a rough patch, but we just have to find the answer for how to get out of it, like my parents.\n\nYou remember that story I told you about my parents.\n\n\n\nYeah, I don't think that story is as cute as you think it is, man.\n\nI mean, I'm sure you were cute, you know?\n\nBig melon head and a little neck tie.\n\nBut that moment, woof.\n\nThat's too much to put on an eight-year-old.\n\nI kinda wish cute little Chidi just got to be a kid rather than a miniature professor trying to solve all the world's problems.\n\nWell, but living that way led me to philosophy, and, sure, I was written up in a medical journal as the youngest person ever with a stress-induced ulcer, but I got into the Good Place, so if you don't mind, I'm gonna take a second to think about what I owe my universe-approved soul mate and and not just, uh, make out with you.\n\nOkay, man.\n\nKiss rescinded.\n\nWe'll just study like two platonic nerds until Michael discovers me or until Esmerelda turns me into a toad with her magic amulet because she can see that we're obviously into each other.\n\nOh, sorry you got an actual human being instead of your true soul mate, a library cart full of damp saltines.\n\nYou are unbelievable!\n\nI don't know what I did to deserve you.\n\nBelieve it, baby.\n\nI'm all yours.\n\nAt least until something better comes along.\n\nFor me.\n\nYou've pretty much topped out.\n\n- You okay?\n\n- No.\n\nI have to give Michael a new draft of my thesis and I'm a mess.\n\n[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]\n\n- Will you help me?\n\n- Woof!\n\nYou want my help with philosophy?\n\nYou must be in rough shape.\n\nI mean, yes, of course.\n\nI'm here for you.\n\nWhat do you need?\n\nI need someone to help guide me, morally speaking, and I think I need it to be you.\n\nThere's a real possibility that I'm in love with you again, here on this plane of existence, uh, today, now.\n\n[LIGHT MUSIC, WHOOSHING]\n\nWe found each other before, hundreds of times.\n\nWe can do it again.\n\nBye, Chidi.\n\nYou're sure you want to do this?\n\nI finally make up my mind about one damn thing, and you try to talk me out of it?\n\nI'm sure.\n\nCan I ask you a question?\n\nSoul mates aren't real, are they?\n\nChidi, in all honesty, I don't know, but I don't think so.\n\nI knew what you expected to find when you got here; answers.\n\n\n\nAlso, if I recall from your file, a magic blackboard?\n\nOne that anticipates your lesson flow.\n\nThat's the dream.\n\nBut mostly you wanted answers.\n\n[BREATHES DEEPLY]\n\nThe soul mate one, in particular.\n\nSo, I used it to t*rture you, which, again, sorry.\n\nIf soul mates do exist, they're not found.\n\nThey're made.\n\nPeople meet, they get a good feeling, and then they get to work building a relationship, like your parents.\n\nThey didn't magically stay together because you proved they should.\n\nIt wasn't my logic or my representation.\n\nIt was the feeling they got watching me this scared little kid telling them that he needed them.\n\nIt was also what you made them remember.\n\nYou know, they loved each other.\n\nSometimes people forget.\n\nYou reminded them of what they already had.\n\nIt convinced them to go to counseling.\n\nI never knew they went to counseling.\n\nYeah, kids are idiots.\n\nIf they knew half the stuff their folks were up to, they'd lose

her to see the light.\n\nI already showed her the light.\n\nShe wasn't impressed.\n\nTo be fair, she was there when it was invented.\n\n- Hey, bud?\n\n- Hi.\n\nI know you're trying to think of ways to save every soul who's ever lived and whatnot, but, um, we may only have a half hour left to exist, so I just wanted to check in with you vis-\xc3 -vis us.\n\nOh, okay, yeah.\n\nCool.\n\nI love you.\n\nWhoa.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah.\n\nI love you.\n\nSo, uh, do you love me?\n\n- Yeah, I do.\n\n- Well, then, cool!\n\nYou and I are on our way to Coolsville.\n\nYou seem oddly sure, which is unlike you, but it's kind of doing it for me.\n\nShould we get out of here?\n\nNo, but I like the confidence.\n\nWell, when you have a thousand different versions of yourself over multiple timelines fused and instantly placed into your consciousness, it gives you a real sense of clarity.\n\nYou saw the time knife, huh?\n\nYep.\n\nSaw the time knife.\n\nIt was neat.\n\nOkay, let's save humanity, shall we?\n\nCan one of you Janets get me a chalkboard and a copy of Judith Shklar's \"Ordinary Vices?\" Oh, and maybe some warm pretzels.\n\nIf we going out, I'm going out with a belly full of warm pretzels.\n\nYummy, yum, yum.\n\nYummy!\n\n[SERENE MUSIC]\n\nOkay, before we try to completely redesign the entire afterlife, has anyone just thought of a good reason the Judge shouldn't cancel Earth?\n\nBecause it would be a bummer.\n\nYeah, we might need more than that.\n\nAre you at least gonna write it down?\n\n[MUTTERS]\n\nDid you actually write it down, or did you just do a scribble-scrabble?\n\nOkay, we need to think bigger.\n\nWe need to come up with an entirely new afterlife system that both the Good and Bad Places agree on, which seems impossible.\n\nNonsense.\n\nCompromise is always possible.\n\nI was once in Portofino with Bruno Mars, LeBron James, and Dr.\n\nRuth Westheimer We don't have time for this right now, babe.\n\nFine.\n\nLong story short, LeBron performed a successful tracheotomy, the son won multiple Grammys, and everyone was really happy.\n\nWell, now I want to hear the story.\n\nNo, you're right.\n\nLet's focus.\n\nSo, in this essay, \"Putting Cruelty First,\" Judith Shklar contends that we should consider cruelty as society's primary flaw.\n\nI'm sorry, are you wearing roller skates?\n\nYeah.\n\nI got them from Disco Janet.\n\nThanks, Disco Janet.\n\n- Solid.\n\n- Anyway, here's her point.\n\nImagine someone sells a joint and then gets locked away in a dangerous prison for years.\n\nThe crime isn't cruel, but the punishment is.\n\n- That's a problem.\n\n- Tell me about it.\n\nI once went to jail for a week just because I stole a hot dog.\n\nWell, a hot-dog-shaped car.\n\nI stole the Wienermobile.\n\nThis is the problem with the current system.\n\nLive anything less than the most exemplary life, and you are brutally tortured forever with no recourse.\n\nThe cruelty of the punishment does not match the cruelty of the life that one has lived.\n\nNow, watch this spin.\n\nSo we need to come up with a system that will result in the least amount of cruelty and suffering to those who don't deserve it.\n\nThis is a problem of justice.\n\n[UPBEAT MUSIC]\n\nHearing you talk about philosophical concepts of justice is sexy.\n\n- You want to get out of here?\n\n- Yes.\n\nNo.\n\nKeep going.\n\nUgh.\n\nBad Janet voids are the worst.\n\nMusic off!\n\n- [VOLUME INCREASES]\n\n- Oh, right, I forgot.\n\n- Make it louder!\n\n- [MUSIC STOPS]\n\nWhat if you start humanity over from scratch, and humans evolve over millions of years and they end up worse?\n\nWhat if they invent rap-rock sooner, and it becomes the only kind of music?\n\n\n\nDo you really want to oversee an entire world of Limp Bizkits run by Emperor Kid Rock?\n\nNot my problem.\n\nAll right, here we go.\n\nSoftware update?\n\nNo, cancel.\n\nWhy is it doing it now?\n\n[GRUNTS]\n\nThis computer sucks.\n\n- [VOICE HURLS]\n\n- Okay, mama.\n\nSee you in the next life.\n\nBefore you marbleize me, can I just make one final statement to summarize how I really feel?\n\nI think I know where this is going.\n\n[LOUD FARTING]\n\nOkay, Disco Janet, you're up.\n\nOut of sight.\n\nWhat are you guys still doing here?\n\nJust go back to Mindy's and have a lukewarm beer, and wait for me to end you there.\n\nExcept for you, cookie-puss.\n\nI'll always make room for you.\n\nWait a second.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI agree.\n\nChidi should hook up with the Judge to get us out of trouble.\n\nI'd done that a bunch of times.\n\nIt's called a Jacksonville plea bargain.\n\nNo, Mindy's house.\n\nEleanor always thought there should be a Medium Place for people who led medium lives.\n\nThat's the answer.\n\nWe make the Medium Place a third option.\n\nOf course.\n\nMaybe if you score negative points on Earth sorry, you blew it.\n\nEnjoy having your p*nis flattened.\n\nOver a million or whatever, party time.\n\nAnd everyone else in between gets their own personal Cincinnati.\n\nIt's definitely less cruel than the current system, but it's not great.\n\n\n\nWell, it might be the best we can do given the circumstances.\n\nLet's try to sell it to the brass.\n\n[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]\n\nHello, all.\n\nThought as the universe is ending, you'd be less cheery.\n\nHard not to be cheery when you're eating this delicious frozen yogurt.\n\nI got a small amount of each flavor.\n\nIt's the only way to ensure a mouthful of compromise.\n\n- You are so right.\n\n- Well said.\n\nShut up!\n\nShut up.\n\nHi.\n\nShut up.\n\n- I'm confident now.\n\n- Oh, sorry.\n\nWe're just short on time.\n\nLook, we have a new idea about how humans could be placed in the afterlife We love it.\n\nWe're in.\n\nYou don't even want to hear it?\n\nNope.\n\nIf you guys came up with it, it must be good.\n\n- Oh, yeah.\n\n- Guys, they said yes.\n\nLet's take the win.\n\nNow all we have to do is convince Shawn.\n\nI'll take the lead.\n\nIf I can convince Dr.\n\nRuth not to sue Bruno Mars over songwriting credit on \"Uptown Funk,\" I can handle this.\n\nOkay, you gotta tell me that story on the way.\n\nSo anyone who doesn't meet the threshold for the new Medium Place Neighborhood is yours for the taking.\n\nThe Bad Place still has plenty of people to t*rture.\n\nI have to admit this does make sense.\n\nAnd I like that your side is settling for a crappy deal while my side stays mostly the same.\n\nWhat the hell.\n\nI'm in.\n\n- Really?\n\n- No.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nYou actually believed me?\n\nDude, in 20 minutes, all of humanity is going to be erased forever.\n\nAnd?\n\nThe Bad Place will get emptied out, too.\n\nYou will have no one to t*rture for billions of years.\n\nEveryone loses.\n\nOh, I know.\n\nBut here's the thing.\n\nI don't care if everyone loses as long as you lose.\n\n- Shawn, listen to reason.\n\n- Why should I?\n\nNone of this would've happened if you hadn't mucked around with your Neighborhood and your new ideas.\n\nNew ideas are gross.\n\nThey sicken me.\n\nShawn, you used to be cool, but you've changed, man.\n\nI'm gonna go write an evil speech for when this is all over.\n\nIt is gonna be so long.\n\n[DISCO MUSIC]\n\nBOTH: You can ring my bell Ring my bell Whoa!\n\nYou can ring my bell Wait a second.\n\nWhat was I doing?\n\nI'll tell you what you were doing.\n\nYou were tearing up the dance floor.\n\nNo, I was looking for the stupid clicker thingy.\n\nGod, those infectious disco grooves.\n\nSo wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\nWe have this amazing new idea, and Shawn is almost on board.\n\nMaybe if you talk to him, you could nudge him towards an agreement.\n\nI don't take sides.\n\nI am the Judge.\n\nMy only concerns are fairness and impartiality.\n\nGonna erase the Earth Erase the Earth That song is really my yam.\n\nHumanity eraser thingy.\n\n[BUZZER SOUNDS]\n\nWelp.\n\nLater, skater.\n\nKeep on truckin'.\n\nNext!\n\nEven for a demon, Shawn is being a real knob.\n\nGuys, I know what we have to offer him to get him to change his mind.\n\n- What?\n\n- Something he wants.\n\nOnce we figure that out, we're golden.\n\nIt's pointless.\n\nHe's so focused on beating us that he's willing to burn everything down.\n\nThere's nothing we can offer him.\n\nActually, there is something he wants.\n\nCruelty.\n\nSo let's give it to him.\n\nOh, hey, guys.\n\nJust smashing some stuff.\n\n- What's up?\n\n- Listen, demon, we know how much you want us to lose, so we volunteer to lose permanently if you agree to let the Judge establish a real Medium Place.\n\nYou can t*rture the four of us forever.\n\n- Really?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nThis is a classic trolley problem.\n\nOne of your boys sets off a stink b*mb on the trolley, causing a commotion so the rest of the group can pickpocket people as they run off the train.\n\nThat's very wrong, but in a roundabout way, you kind of got where you needed to be.\n\nI'll even give you a head start on my t*rture.\n\nI cannot pull off the \"mod\" look.\n\nYou can take me, too.\n\nI couldn't live with myself knowing you four were down there without me.\n\nWow.\n\nThis is a toughy.\n\nOn one hand, I would love to get some spiders in those buttholes.\n\nOn the other hand, there would be billions of buttholes going completely un-spidered.\n\nHow about this?\n\nEveryone who dies go to the Bad Place and I get to t*rture all of you.\n\nSounds good to us.\n\nNo, dummies.\n\nThat's already how it works, except we're also tortured.\n\nLook, I put forward a proposal.\n\nAre you not even going to negotiate?\n\nHe's got a point.\n\nThe fair thing for us to do is just keep on giving up more and more stuff we want unilaterally until this demon's finally happy.\n\nFork this.\n\nIf we're gonna lose, let's lose on our own terms.\n\nLet's come up with a completely new idea that actually makes the universe better.\n\nAmen.\n\nAt least then, we can hold our heads high.\n\nOkay, we need to come up with our ideal plan in about 10 minutes.\n\nGuys, it's all come to this.\n\nEverything we've been through multiple lives you led on Earth, all the lives you led here, all the ethics training and lessons and journeys to the farthest corners of the afterlife all happened so that we could be here together as the very best versions of ourselves, to solve the ultimate problem in the nick of time.\n\nCool speech.\n\nNow it's nine minutes.\n\nChidi, can you do this?\n\nActually, what you just said, the very best versions of ourselves, gave me an idea.\n\nHuh.\n\nTurns out it was a cool speech.\n\n[GLASS SHATTERS]\n\nNot in you, either.\n\nI just have one thing left to say.\n\n- [BABBLES]\n\n- No.\n\nNot falling for that again.\n\n[FARTING NOISE]\n\nMan, she is committed.\n\nThat just leaves you.\n\nYour Honor, we have an idea we'd like to present Not interested, stretch.\n\nHow can we convince her of our plan if she won't even listen?\n\n\n\nWell, if she's not gonna stay out here, you gotta go in there.\n\nBut that didn't really work great last time.\n\nYeah, it wasn't an amazing, but she's gonna marbleize me in, like, two minutes, so we might as well try.\n\nAre we all gonna be - you again?\n\n- I don't think so.\n\nGoing through that once changed me and all of you.\n\nBut if the Judge wasn't gonna listen to us out here, what makes you think she'll listen to us in there?\n\nI know one thing that might keep her attention.\n\nIdiots.\n\nAw, nuts.\n\nHow did I fall for that?\n\n- Please, have a seat, Your Honor.\n\n- I already told you.\n\nI'm not interested.\n\nGive me one reason why I should hear you out?\n\nOkay.\n\nHere he is.\n\nMa'am.\n\n\n\nYou made me an Olyphant?\n\nI think you should hear them out, Judge.\n\nOnly seems fair.\n\nYeah, you're probably right.\n\nWell played, Janet.\n\nI don't mind taking in the view when the scenery is so pretty.\n\nOh, I should call Shawn for this.\n\nAw, man.\n\nI had just gotten all the puppies to climb into the cannon.\n\nAll right.\n\nFloor is yours.\n\nSo the problem with the afterlife is not only that it's cruel, but that it's final.\n\nYou get one shot on Earth, and regardless of the context of your life, you're placed somewhere, usually the Bad Place, forever with no chance for redemption.\n\n\n\nMy Neighborhood was built to t*rture humans, but it made them better.\n\nWe want to create a system that works that way intentionally, a system designed to give people a fighting chance.\n\nHuh.\n\nInteresting.\n\nWhy don't you walk us through it?\n\nYeah, we're gonna, man.\n\nJust chill.\n\nYour time on Earth won't be a test that you either pass or fail, but instead a class you take, and the test will come in the afterlife.\n\nThe first part stays the same.\n\nYou live your life, screw up a bunch of stuff.\n\nLike, a lot of stuff.\n\nLike, to the point where people are, like this is mess up, even for Florida.\n\nBut you can't hear them because you fell into the swamp trying to spray paint a Taco Bell logo on a snapping turtle.\n\nWe rest our case, Your Honor.\n\n- No, no.\n\n- No, no, no, no, no, we don't.\n\nWe barely started.\n\nSo when you die, you still have a points total, but in the new system, that number will serve as a sort of baseline to determine how hard or how easy your test is.\n\nSorry.\n\nI'm just trying to play catch-up here.\n\nWho's designing these tests, exactly?\n\nA Good Place architect and a Bad Place architect will work together to design a scenario to make you confront your moral shortcomings, like Eleanor's selfishness, Jason's impulsivity, Chidi's indecisiveness, and my complete inability to carry off a mod look.\n\n- That's not - I know I have other faults, but that is a big one.\n\nThe test could be anything.\n\nMaybe you show up and you're told you're in the Good Place, but you know that it's a mistake.\n\nMaybe the test looks just like your regular life, or a twisted version of your life.\n\nYou're presented with these challenges.\n\nDo well or badly, at the end, you're given a sort of evaluation.\n\nYeah, and the architects explain what you did badly, what you did well, and then you get rebooted and do it again and again and again until you ace it.\n\nOh, hang on.\n\nIt seems to me if y'all get rebooted, your memories will be wiped out.\n\nHow you ever gonna learn anything if you're always having to start from scratch?\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\n- Good point, Timothy Olyphant.\n\n- Tim's fine.\n\n- Okay, great.\n\nIn the new system, you will retain a vague memory of what you learned in the evaluation sessions.\n\nThat information, what you did well or badly, stays with you like like a little voice in your head, helping you become a better version of yourself.\n\nOkay, that helps.\n\nThank you.\n\nSo our guess is that with enough chances, people will eventually make enough good choices to qualify for the Good Place, and maybe some never will, but that's okay because everyone gets a fair shot.\n\nHold the phone.\n\nWhat are my demons doing this whole time?\n\nI have millions of lava monsters down there who will be out of a job.\n\nI ask you, into whose throats are they supposed to pour lava?\n\n\n\nWell, bad news is no more throat lava or p*nis flattenings.\n\nThen what are we doing to their penises?\n\nWell, largely, ignoring them.\n\nYou guys are hearing this.\n\nI'm not crazy, right?\n\nNo, I mean, it's a fair question.\n\nWhose side are you on, man?\n\nI don't have a dog in this fight, little lady.\n\nI'm just looking for clarity.\n\nShawn, you'll all still have jobs.\n\nBad place architects help design the test.\n\nRank and file demons, they'll play-role just like they did in my original Neighborhood.\n\nAnd remember how much fun you had playing the Judge?\n\nI don't know, guys.\n\nYou think this will work?\n\nIt sort of already has.\n\nChidi just had 800 versions of himself stuffed into his soul at the same time.\n\nI mean, he's a new man.\n\nHe's way cooler now.\n\nI like the old version, too, but not as much.\n\nIt's not just Chidi, Your Honor.\n\nWhen I started in Michael's first Neighborhood, I was nothing more than a PalmPilot in a cool vest.\n\nBut look at me now.\n\nI can hold four humans in my void, and conjure Timothy Olyphant in the blink of an eye.\n\nGetting rebooted over and over made me a better not-a-person than I've ever been.\n\nHumans should get the same opportunity.\n\n[PENSIVE MUSIC]\n\nWell?\n\nMm pass.\n\nWell, guys, I really thought you had it.\n\nIt has been a genuine pleasure, sweetie.\n\nOh.\n\nGonna erase the Earth Erase the Earth I hid the clicker as far away as possible, but we are seconds away.\n\nI'm so sorry, guys.\n\nWhere did Shawn go?\n\nOh, don't bother.\n\nHe's just toying with us.\n\nI know.\n\nThat's what gives me hope.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nHad to do it one last time before all this goes away for good.\n\nSo what are you offering me now?\n\nNothing.\n\nIt's over.\n\nThat was our last idea.\n\nGood.\n\nSoon, all your precious humans will be gone.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's too bad.\n\nWell, congrats, bud.\n\nYou won.\n\nSee you in a billion years.\n\nWhen the humans evolve again, I'll be right back at your throat, you traitor.\n\nI mean, yeah, I know.\n\nThat's why I said, \"See you in a billion years.\n\n\" Wait.\n\nI'm gonna do the evil speech now.\n\nIf you want.\n\n[CLEARS THROAT]\n\nSince the dawn of time, good and evil have waged a furious battle, stemming from this feels stupid if you're not gonna fight back.\n\nHow do you not have another plan?\n\nYou've always had another plan.\n\nWhat's wrong, Shawn?\n\nOkay, fine.\n\nGonna make me admit it.\n\nFighting you is the most fun I've ever had.\n\nI mean, you know.\n\nYou corkscrew your first eyeball, and you're like, man, I can't believe they're paying me to do this.\n\nBy the trillionth, it's like I should've just been a teacher.\n\n\n\nAnd then you go and get the warm fuzzies about your little humans, and something something changed.\n\nI was having fun again.\n\nI'm not sure I'm ready for that to end.\n\nI know, buddy.\n\nIt's hard when things end.\n\nBut one way or the other, this is over.\n\nThe only question is what's next?\n\nI heard your speech at Demon-Con.\n\nYou know this system stinks.\n\nYou wouldn't have let me try the original experiment if things were working.\n\nLet's try a new way together.\n\n[BITTERSWEET MUSIC]\n\nOkay, finally.\n\nFor the last time, I, the Judge of the afterlife - Hang on, Your Honor.\n\n- [GROANS]\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nCan't a gal just end all of humanity one time without everyone getting all up on her junk?\n\nWhat is it, man?\n\nShawn has agreed to our proposal.\n\nWait, seriously?\n\nIn principle, yes.\n\nStill some kinks to work in - Out.\n\n- Out.\n\nSorry.\n\nOld habits.\n\nBut I think we can find a way to make it work.\n\n- Guys, watch this.\n\n- [ALL SCREAMING]\n\nSorry.\n\nJeez.\n\nOkay, well, assuming we are redesigning the entire afterlife according to this plan what do we do first?\n\nOh, don't look at me.\n\nI'm I'm just the

is an excuse that's been used for hundreds of years to justify racism, misogyny Exactly.\n\nSee?\n\nThis chick gets it.\n\n[SERENE MUSIC]\n\nSo these computers have access to every file for every human currently in the Bad Place, and the three of us have a very important job.\n\nTo find out which former U.\n\nS.\n\npresidents were secretly gay.\n\n- No.\n\n- Okay, fine, bi.\n\nSure, but also, while Michael is trying to get the Architects trained, we're supposed to find the first 1,000 humans to take the test people who will just sail right through it so we can build confidence in the system.\n\nSo what are the criteria?\n\nShould it be people with the highest point totals or overcame the greatest hardship?\n\nI think we just start with the gimmes the very best people who ever lived.\n\n\n\nSo Evel Knievel, Kool-Aid Man, Mini-Me, DJ Jazzy Jeff, a genie so we can wish for infinity people.\n\n- Jason - Sure, throw me in there, too.\n\nAlso, Fat Bastard, the World's Most Interesting Man, Pikachu, Karate Kid, Wendy from Wendy's, Grumpy Cat, and the GPS lady that tells you where to drive.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nFeels like a good stopping point.\n\nLet's call it a day, come back

you reading about?\n\nMe.\n\nI ruled on Earth.\n\nI siphoned so much gas, Eleanor.\n\nEven if the car was moving or on fire or a boat, I still always got that gas.\n\nOh, man.\n\nI never thought about the fact that we could look up our own files.\n\nYeah, I printed out all of ours.\n\nI love you, okay?\n\nOh.\n\nThe words are nice, but the tone is scary.\n\nWe're in love, and everything's great, and if we want to keep it that way, you have to promise to never, ever, ever read my file.\n\nOkay.\n\nIf you don't want me to, then of course I won't, but nothing in there could ever change how I feel about you.\n\nEh, you say that now, but you don't know what I did on Halloween 2013.\n\nWhat did you do on Halloween 2013?\n\nOh, I don't remember, but it must've been bad, because the next morning, I woke up in a large Rubbermaid container in some family's basement, and I had barfed all over their old photo albums.\n\nYeah, see, that's the look we're trying to avoid here, bud.\n\nI don't need to read your file.\n\nI know you, and I love you.\n\nAnd I can't wait to spend eternity with you.\n\nI mean, obviously, we have a lot of work to do here, and then we both have to pass the test, but eventually we're gonna be together forever You have to read my file right now!\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm confused.\n\nIs this a game?\n\nIs it a sex game somehow?\n\nI can't risk it.\n\nWhat if we spend half of eternity together and then you find out something that does change the way you feel about me and then you resent me for wasting half your eternity?\n\nNo, it's better we just rip the Band-Aid off, and you read about all the bad stuff now when we're hot and heavy.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'll read your file.\n\nCan I finish reading about Oskar Schindler first?\n\nThat's who I got to follow?\n\nThe list guy?\n\nYou and I are so screwed, dude.\n\nAfter as many attempts as it takes, if your human passes the test and proves that they deserve to go to the Good Place, you'll hear this sound.\n\n- [BRIGHT CHIME]\n\n- Good Place, here I come.\n\nThis new system is great.\n\nWho do we have to thank for effortlessly implementing it?\n\nWhoever it is, I think we can all agree it was a

think we should stop.\n\n- Okay, so, thoughts?\n\nYeah.\n\nThis all sounds so lame.\n\nNo, it's the current system that's lame.\n\nIt's so basic.\n\nYou get a human's file, and let's be honest, you never even read it.\n\nYou just skip to the fears and phobias section and use that to t*rture them.\n\nFear of snakes, throw them in a snake pit.\n\nWorried something's gonna happen to your normal cylindrical p*nis, flatten it.\n\nThis new way allows you to test their specific psychological flaws and weaknesses.\n\nAnd trust us, they have plenty.\n\n- Hey.\n\n- Sorry.\n\nI'm in selling mode.\n\nGuys, this is your chance to be part of a bold new future.\n\nYou telling me there's not one single demon who wants to design the very first sample test of this new system?\n\nOh, there is.\n\nAnd she's a stone-cold fox.\n\nVicky, what are you doing here?\n\nRelax.\n\nI heard about the new system, I love it, and I want to be a part of it.\n\nForgive me if I'm a little skeptical, given that you did once try to sabotage my entire Neighborhood.\n\nLook, after you blew me into goo, I had a lot of time to think, while my goo was re-forming.\n\n\n\nIf things are gonna change, then I have to change along with them.\n\n\n\nAnd, sure, change can be scary, but I'm an artist which means it's my job to be scared.\n\nAll right, fine.\n\nTake a seat.\n\nJanet'll give you Tahani's file.\n\nOh, no, I don't I don't need her file.\n\nI know Tahani very well self-obsessed, family issues, way too into being tall.\n\nTypical Vicky throwing shade.\n\nBut it doesn't matter 'cause I'm casting it.\n\nBecause I'm closer to the Sun.\n\nI'm tall.\n\nOh, no.\n\nI knew it.\n\nYou hate me now.\n\nWhat did it?\n\nThe time I was subpoenaed by the Make-A-Wish Foundation?\n\n- No.\n\n- Oh, I know what it was.\n\nIn my defense, I didn't realize he was my boyfriend's twin until halfway into hooking up with him, and at that point, you know, it's a sunk cost.\n\nI don't hate you at all.\n\nI mean, you were dealt a pretty tough hand.\n\nYou essentially had to raise yourself, but you were still more confident and self-possessed at 13 than I ever was.\n\nI mean, seeing your whole life all laid out like this, it's it's remarkable.\n\nOkay, so you still love me.\n\nYou're still horny for me, blah, blah, blah.\n\nThen what's wrong?\n\nI'm not good enough for you.\n\nI mean, look at my file.\n\nIt is 1/10 as long as yours because I did nothing with my life.\n\nYeah, we're very different, but we already knew that.\n\nWhy are you freaking out?\n\nYou're cool, confident Chidi now, remember?\n\nI am confident about my feelings for you.\n\nI am also confident that I am a damn drip, and you deserve to be with someone who's not.\n\nLike Nicolas, that fireman that you dated back in 2009.\n\nHe rescued people from burning buildings, and he was so hot.\n\nOh, Nicolas the fireman.\n\nMmm.\n\nNicolas.\n\nI can't argue with you on that one, but I love you.\n\nThere is no one else I want to be with at least not forever.\n\nI mean, if Frida Kahlo wants to make out with me in Heaven, then you and I are gonna have a conversation, but if you read my file and you're good, then we're good, unless there's something in your file that would freak me out, like you kept out a library book past the due date.\n\nI moved, and it got buried in the bottom of a box.\n\nI put the library in my will to make up for it.\n\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nRelax.\n\nLet's get back to work.\n\nNow, when I press this lever, Tahani will enter the scenario that Megan has designed that will test her ethical decision-making.\n\nObviously, in the real test, the humans won't know they're being tested, but this should be a good practice run.\n\nEveryone ready?\n\n[ELEGANT MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nHors d'oeuvre?\n\nWhy, yes.\n\nThank you.\n\n- Chain saw bear!\n\n- [SCREAMS]\n\nOkay, so couple of things.\n\nWe're not using chain saw bears anymore, remember?\n\nRight.\n\nOkay, yeah.\n\nWhat else?\n\nIt was mainly that one thing.\n\nWhy don't you try again?\n\nAnd remember, the challenges your test subject faces should smaller and and more relatable.\n\nOkay.\n\nHors d'oeuvre?\n\nIt's salmon crudit\xc3\xa9s.\n\nIs it farm-raised salmon?\n\n'Cause I prefer to support sustainable fishing.\n\n[CLEARS THROAT]\n\nMondays.\n\nAm I right?\n\nChain saw!\n\nYou said smaller and more relatable.\n\nThe bear is smaller, humans hate Mondays and love bacon.\n\nWhat do you want from me?\n\nMichael, can I try?\n\nI can show them what you're trying to do.\n\nFine, Vicky.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nNow, first, I need to get into Tahani's headspace.\n\n[BRITISH ACCENT]\n\n'Ello, love.\n\nPish-posh.\n\nTuna and pickles.\n\nI once played billiards with Questlove and Olivia Munn.\n\n[NORMAL VOICE]\n\nYeah, there she is.\n\nOkay, just give me a second.\n\n[CLEARS THROAT]\n\nWhew.\n\nJust finished reading up about James Buchanan.\n\nDefinitely at least a little bi.\n\nI'm gonna put him in the maybe pile.\n\n[GRUNTS]\n\nI want nachos.\n\nIs there a snack bar here?\n\nWhat's going on, dog?\n\nI know you're upset.\n\nYou have a tell.\n\n- I do?\n\n- Yeah, you \"telled\" Eleanor before that you were upset, and I think you still are.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nLooking at Eleanor's life made me realize how different we are.\n\nIf the system works and we both pass our tests, I don't see any version of eternity where she doesn't get bored of me.\n\nI mean, my fake heaven was a 600-square-foot apartment that was essentially a bookcase and a toilet, and I loved it.\n\nSo what?\n\nIt's cool that you guys are so different.\n\nSometimes two people who have nothing in common get together, and it rules.\n\n- Opposites attract.\n\n- Well, you need that to be true because you're dating Janet.\n\nUltimate opposites.\n\nSo, what, are you saying Janet might get bored of me?\n\nNo, that's not I'm sorry.\n\nI-I didn't mean Man Oh, no.\n\nNo, Jason, come back.\n\nI [SIGHS]\n\nI wish I were back in my toilet library.\n\nAnd places.\n\nAnd action.\n\n[INDISTINCT CHATTER]\n\nCan you believe we're still having this dinner for Kamilah?\n\nSo embarrassing.\n\nShe doesn't know this yet, but I heard that the reviews for her new\xa0\xa0album\xa0are going to be dreadful.\n\nThe rumor is that the label is going to drop her.\n\nI heard she may have to fly home coach and check a bag, whatever that means.\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\n- [TAPS GLASS]\n\nThank you, everyone, for coming to celebrate our daughter Kamilah.\n\nI know you're all very busy these days.\n\nJust look at our other daughter, Tahani.\n\nShe had to come straight from the gym.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nWould anyone like to say a few words of praise about Kamilah's latest album or any other aspect of Kamilah?\n\nThere are so many to celebrate.\n\nPerhaps Tahani should speak.\n\nShe's had her share of failures recently.\n\nCelebrating me could be therapeutic.\n\nCertainly.\n\nI can say something.\n\nBut I have no idea what.\n\nGoodness, this is hard.\n\n[DOOR OPENS]\n\nWell done, Vicky.\n\nThat was quite good for the system.\n\nFor me, it was rather traumatic.\n\nOkay, so, like, her parents were the chain saw bear, but instead of chopping off her head, they chopped off her self-esteem?\n\nYes, Megan.\n\nGood.\n\nTake what you know about them and then force them into moments of personal difficulty.\n\nThink of it as flattening the penises of their heart.\n\nOh.\n\nNow it makes sense.\n\nWhy don't you go deeper into her file and look for other ways to challenge her?\n\nAll right, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down here.\n\nVicky's example was fine.\n\nThere was some good stuff there.\n\nBut overall, uh, C-plus.\n\nIt was a C-plus, I'd say.\n\nThere are some problems with it, some technical issues that only I can see and everything.\n\nSo, basically, it actually kind of stunk.\n\nSo I think it's just best if you leave, Vicky.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nYou're bad at this.\n\nC-plus.\n\nOkay, good-bye.\n\nWow.\n\nSame old Michael.\n\nJust can't share the spotlight.\n\n\n\n- Hmm.\n\n- Well, good-bye, everyone.\n\nThat's a wrap on Vicky.\n\nMichael, why did you fire Vicky?\n\nLook, I know she did well on the first test, but it's beginner's luck.\n\nThere's an X factor here a secret sauce that only I truly know how to pour over the the juicy s-steak of this process.\n\nI've never said this before, but what?\n\nNot only is Vicky good at test design, but she's good at teaching the others.\n\nWell, that's the problem.\n\nShe's moving too fast.\n\nWe have to learn how to walk before we can run.\n\nSo, first, you thought it would take forever, and now it's moving too fast?\n\nFirst of all, you know, uh, shut up.\n\nA-and second of all, just shut up.\n\n- [GASPS]\n\n- It's obvious what's going on here.\n\nYou don't want your nemesis - to be the one to solve your problem.\n\n- I know that feeling.\n\nOnce, on Earth, I didn't know something, and I had to ask Alexa.\n\nI felt dirty.\n\nNo, that's not it.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nI'm upset, because for hundreds of years, I've had a job.\n\nFirst, it was finding a better way to t*rture humans, then helping them, then proving the system was broken, then teaching the demons.\n\n\n\nI have to roll a rock up a hill over and over, and then it kept rolling down, so I had to do it again.\n\nAnd then Vicky comes along with this like, rock-lifter thing and just lifts it to the top of the hill.\n\nPushing the rock up the hill gave me a purpose.\n\nWho am I if the rock's gone?\n\nIronically, that's exactly what Vin Diesel asked me when Dwayne Johnson refused to appear in \"The Fast and the Furious 9.\n\n\" Not helpful?\n\nCopy that.\n\nHonestly Michael, I don't know what's to become of you or any of us.\n\nBut getting Vicky back is the best chance to make your plan work now, so focus on that and deal with the future in the future.\n\nHey.\n\nUm I'm sorry I said that before, man.\n\nNo, you were right.\n\nJanet and I are different.\n\nMaybe it can't last.\n\nMaybe we're like the Montagues and Capulets.\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nI read some books, man.\n\nJeez.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nUh, listen.\n\nMaybe on paper, you and Janet don't make total sense, but who cares?\n\nThe relationship you have built together is wonderful.\n\n\n\nShe knows you and loves you, and that's all that matters.\n\n- Do you really believe that?\n\n- Of course I do.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nSucker!\n\nSorry?\n\nI got you so bad.\n\nDude, pretend what you just said was what you said to you instead of to me.\n\nAnd you have to listen to yourself, because it was already in your own head and then came out.\n\nBut just put it back in your head, and realize that it was you talking about you and Eleanor.\n\nAgainst all odds, I know what you mean, and I-I got to give it up.\n\nThat was that was good.\n\nYeah, it was.\n\nChess mate.\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nHey!\n\n[CLAPS HANDS]\n\nThere she is.\n\nWhere you off to?\n\nI have an ice-cold yoga class.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nYou pull so many muscles.\n\n- [CHUCKLES]\n\n- What do you want?\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nI-I'm sorry that I kicked you out.\n\nI-It wasn't about you.\n\nIt was just my own insecurities getting in the way.\n\nWill you please come back?\n\nNo.\n\nI'm not gonna let myself be degraded by you again.\n\nI am a strong, independent acid snake in the skin suit of a strong, independent woman.\n\nListen, listen, uh You were the best part of my original Neighborhood.\n\nI took you for granted, and that was wrong.\n\nBut now I want to give you the role of a lifetime.\n\nYou're going to run the whole project.\n\nI'll give you all my plans and my notes, but then I'll I'll step back, and and you'll take over.\n\nFull creative control like a director.\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nWell, um that sounds great, but it won't work.\n\nEveryone here hates you so much, if you just put me in control, they'll think I'm your puppet.\n\nI can't have any of your dingleberry stank on me.\n\nI know.\n\nThat's why I'm not giving it to you.\n\nYou're going to take it.\n\nHey.\n\nSo, uh I was being stupid.\n\nAnd Jason gave me some really good advice.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nClassic us.\n\nLook, who we were on Earth is a tiny part of who we are and an even smaller part of who we are together.\n\nSo I'm sorry for freaking out.\n\nBut also, some day when we get to the Good Place, I'm gonna learn to play the\xa0\xa0guitar\xa0so you don't get bored of me.\n\nI actually prefer drummers.\n\nRead my file.\n\nSorry for the delay.\n\nNow, for this next phase of the training - Stop right there.\n\n- Vicky?\n\nI thought I got rid of you, and now you're coming through the door unexpectedly?\n\nThat's right.\n\nI'm launching a coup.\n\nMy, my, my, we've got some history, don't we?\n\nBut I am still standing, Mikey boy.\n\nAnd right now I'm taking over.\n\nExplain what you mean for me and everyone else.\n\nOh, this is my training now.\n\nYou're done.\n\nAnd all of these demons are behind me, right, guys?\n\n- Yep.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nAll right, Vicky, you win this time.\n\n- Tahani, Janet, let's go.\n\n- Hmm.\n\nNo, but wait, wait.\n\nWe're we're still fighting.\n\nAnd it's so heated that, um, it might just erupt into [WHISPERING]\n\nThe dance battle from \"West Side Story.\n\n\" No, I'm I'm too upset about the coup thing.\n\nHurry up, hurry

way, Janet?\n\nWell, I've never been to the Good Place before, but yes, I'm sure.\n\n- How?\n\n- Because it feels like I'm on my way home.\n\nFlying puppy!\n\nYou're almost there!\n\nJust a little further.\n\nFlying puppies?\n\nDang it, Michael, why didn't you think of that for your neighborhood?\n\nThese guys are good.\n\n- - [ETHEREAL SHIMMERING]\n\n[QUIRKY MUSIC]\n\nI feel just like Dorothy when she lands in Oz.\n\nExcited, incredulous, much taller than everyone else around me.\n\nWhat's everyone wanna do first?\n\nRacing go-karts with monkeys.\n\nSure.\n\nIt's my lifelong dream.\n\nMonkeys are the ideal go-kart opponents.\n\nThey're funny enough to give the finger, but not smart enough to win.\n\n- - Does that mean me?\n\nYou're a Good Janet, and we're in the Good

Place.\n\nIn a nutshell, it slaps.\n\nFirst thing to tell you: humans can't see the Good Place all at once or their brains will be scrambled.\n\nCool, maybe I'll finally get some of those squigglies on my brain.\n\nDoctor said my brain's as smooth as an egg.\n\nYou all need to wait out here for a bit so you can adjust.\n\nWhen you're ready, you will be honored with a welcome gala magically planned by the Good Place based on your personalities.\n\nLike the \"targeted Instagram ad\" of parties!\n\nYou know, I bought the coolest sunglasses from one of those ads.\n\n- [PINGING]\n\n-

it'll just be butterflies - or something.\n\n- I'm fine, I just um I don't belong here.\n\nThere's no telling what will happen to a demon who steps foot in this place.\n\nPromise me if I'm vaporized, you guys just keep having fun.\n\n- [CHIMING]\n\n- Oh, my goodness, that chime is so soothing, it feels like my brain is being massaged - [BOTH]\n\nby a baby deer?\n\n- Oh, boy.\n\nWhat if that's some

her.\n\n[SQUEALS]\n\nOoh, Hypatia!\n\nI'm gonna ask her so many questions pertaining to the grand ideas about the universe, like: \"Why?\" Oh, oh, and also \"How?\" - Ooh.\n\n- Welcome to the Good

letting me be here with my friends.\n\n\n\nI know it's unorthodox for someone like myself to visit the Good Place, but it's just so wonderful, and I don't have any weed on me, so no need for the

helped the poor in Ancient Phoenicia.\n\nExcellent!\n\nI once had a Soul Cycle instructor named Phoenicia.\n\nHow did you die?\n\nI got a cut on my hand.\n\nThe year was 2491 BC, so that's pretty much all it took.\n\nYou got a cut, or you drank water that wasn't hot enough, and then boom, dead.\n\nI would've k*lled for a vaccine.\n\nAny vaccine.\n\nIt's crazy that you guys just don't like them now.\n\nSo what's your favorite part about living here?\n\nI mean, it's perfect.\n\nWe're all having orgasms literally all the time.\n\nI died a virgin, so that's real crazy.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt's so nice to get to work alongside another Good Janet.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nJanet, can I get a Coke?\n\n[CHIMING]\n\nNo, a water.\n\n- [CHIMING]\n\n- No, a lamp.\n\n- [CHIMING]\n\n- No, a cat.\n\n- [CHIMING]\n\n- So, people just ask you for things with no rhyme or reason?\n\nYes, and then I get them for them.\n\n- It's great.\n\n- Can I get a spaceship?\n\n[CHIMING]\n\nNo, one huge Junior Mint.\n\n- [CHIMING]\n\n- No, a Coke.\n\n[CHIMING]\n\nWow, this milkshake is incredible.\n\n- Right?\n\n- Mmm!\n\nThis is how I spend most of my time.\n\nSitting in beautiful places, drinking my milkshake, slowly peeing into my pants, which instantly evaporates and leaves no trace.\n\n- Sounds fun.\n\n- Mm.\n\nBut didn't you want to tell us how we're all screwed?\n\nAh!\n\nDamn it!\n\nThis is the exact problem!\n\nOn paper, this is paradise.\n\nAll your desires and needs are met, but it's infinite, and when perfection goes on forever, you become this glassy-eyed mush person.\n\nBut no!\n\nBecause No.\n\nBecause, Patty, no!\n\nYes, I'm telling you.\n\nI used to be cool, man.\n\nI studied so much things.\n\nArt and music and the, um, the one with the number piles?\n\nWhere I'd be like, \"Two!\" and you'd be like, \"Six!\" - Math?\n\n- Yes!\n\n\n\nAnd then I came here where time stretched out forever, and every second of my existence was amazing, but my brain became this big dumb blob.\n\nSo we finally make it into the Good Place, and now we're just gonna become zombies?\n\nWhy haven't you told anyone about this?\n\nAbout what?\n\n- Dude!\n\n- Damn it!\n\nWe have to find the others.\n\nRight now.\n\nLook, there's math on my shirt.\n\n- Come on!\n\n- Is it an \"S\" or a math?\n\nHave you seen Eleanor and Chidi?\n\nThere's something very wrong with this party, and it's not just that the caviar is being served on top of Jell-O sh*ts.\n\nWe are the first new people here in 500 years, and no one seems to care.\n\nI know, even the Good Janets are kind of weird.\n\nThey're like, \"Hi, there!\" When I do it, it's cool, but when they do it, it's lame.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nHaving fun?\n\nGreat.\n\nSo, little update.\n\nUm, the Good Place is a disaster.\n\nEveryone here is a happiness zombie, and no one is doing anything about it, because by the time they realize it's happening, everyone is too far gone to care.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nOh, hello, I'm Tahani.\n\nHi, I'm milkshake.\n\nDo you want a milkshake?\n\nOkay, we need to tell someone before we're too zonked out to remember why we're here.\n\n- We need to find the Committee.\n\n- The Committee is me.\n\nI am Committee.\n\nIt me.\n\n- What?\n\n- They tricked me.\n\nAnd put me in charge of the Good Place and then literally ran away.\n\nAnd then what happened?\n\nThe sorting hat put you in Hufflepuff?\n\nRoasted.\n\nCome on, I know we have problems.\n\n- You can't expect me to ignore this.\n\n- Hang on, - we're in paradise.\n\n- [MONKEY CHITTERING DISTANTLY]\n\nSurely, some people here are enjoying themselves.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nI'm back.\n\nGo-karting with monkeys got boring really fast.\n\nIt did?\n\n- Oh, no!\n\n- Damn it!\n\nJason, your lifelong dream got old that quickly?\n\nI mean, monkeys and go-karts was fun for a while, then I was like, \"Oh, you know what'd be cool?\n\nHippos in go-karts.\n\n\" And I was like, yo, \"What about Draculas with jetpacks?\" I did like 50 combos, and then I just kind of wanted to hang out with you guys again.\n\nOkay, that's it in a nutshell.\n\n'Cause you get here and you realize that anything's possible, and you do everything, and then you're done.\n\nBut you still have infinity left.\n\nThis place kills fun, and passion, and excitement, and love, till all you have left are milkshakes.\n\nThe Good Place Committee obviously knew about this.\n\nWhy didn't they try and solve it?\n\nThey did.\n\nThey tried everything.\n\nJust last week, they made the unicorns bigger, and then they gave them more horns, and then they made them chubbier.\n\nI mean, really, they just made a bunch of weird fluffy rhinos.\n\n\n\nThe Committee members aren't human, so they couldn't understand the problem.\n\n\n\nThe second I showed up, they jumped off this sinking ship and made me captain.\n\nWell, I'm not giving up.\n\nWe worked too hard and went through too much.\n\nAnd I'm not just gonna sit back and turn into some slack-jawed sweatpant-wearing orgasm machine.\n\nOh, my God, I'm describing my dream existence like it's bad.\n\nWhat is wrong with this place?\n\nWe just redesigned this system, and soon millions of people are going to start pouring in thinking they're in paradise, only to become a joyless husk.\n\nIt's Coachella.\n\nWe've invented Cosmic Coachella.\n\nOh, we have to fix this.\n\nWhat if we do what I did to you in the original Neighborhood?\n\nErase their memory every once in a while?\n\nThat way, paradise would seem fresh and new.\n\nYou were doing that to t*rture us.\n\nActual paradise can't use the same playbook as hell.\n\nOkay, well, I have a solution.\n\nRemember what I said to you when you were going through your \"midlife crisis, one earring, red convertible\" phase?\n\n- \"You look so stupid.\n\n\" - After that.\n\nYou said that every human is a little bit sad all the time, because you know you're gonna die.\n\nBut that knowledge is what gives life meaning.\n\nThe way to restore meaning to the people in the Good Place is to let them leave.\n\nLeave?\n\nAnd go where?\n\nThis is the last Oh.\n\nCan we just do that?\n\nYou're the head of the Good Place now.\n\nSeems to me, you can do whatever you want.\n\nWhere's Michael?\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nOkay.\n\n[CHUCKLING]\n\nNothing to do but announce the big change.\n\nWhatever happens, it's cool, my babies.\n\nIt's very cool.\n\nDid you smoke that weed, bud?\n\n[CHUCKLING]\n\nI did.\n\nI was kind of freaked out, so I smoked some grass, but now I'm great.\n\nLet's change the afterlife, - and then Taco Bell.\n\n- All right.\n\n- [CHIMING]\n\n- Oh!\n\n- Baby!\n\n- Okay.\n\nI'm gonna do the talking.\n\nHi, everyone, can I have your attention, please?\n\nHi, my name's Eleanor Shellstrop.\n\nHope you're having fun at our Flor-izona British library extravaganza.\n\nI guess you don't really have fun anywhere, which is the point.\n\nIt doesn't seem like this is paradise for you.\n\nYou've basically been on a never-ending vacation, and vacations are only special because they end.\n\nSo we have an idea.\n\nWe're gonna set up a new kind of door.\n\nUm, somewhere peaceful, so that when you feel happy and satisfied and complete, and you want to leave the Good Place for good, you can just walk through it, and your time in the universe will end.\n\nYou don't have to go through it if you don't want to, but you can, and hopefully, knowing that you don't have to be here forever will help you feel happier while you are.\n\nWhat will happen when we go through it?\n\nWell, we don't really know, exactly.\n\nAll we know is, it will be peaceful, and your journey will be over.\n\nYou led great lives.\n\nYou earned your place here.\n\nSo stay here as long as you like.\n\nUse the Green Doors to see and do every single thing you want to see and do.\n\nAnd when you're ready walk through one last door, and be at peace.\n\nDoes that sound good?\n\n[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n\n[UPLIFTING MUSIC]\n\nSeems like they're into it.\n\n[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nIt's DJ music, make some noise!\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nThat's my boyfriend!\n\nI'm glad you'll be able to enjoy things again.\n\nArt, math, philosophy, like you used to.\n\nYeah, me too.\n\nI've been dreaming of ending the ennui of this eternal existence for a long time, but now I think I'll stick around for a while.\n\nIt felt good to, uh make brain words.\n\nStill mushy.\n\nI'll get it back.\n\nWe're lucky we ran into you.\n\nIt saved us.\n\nThat's not what saved you.\n\n- Hey!\n\n- Hey!\n\n- It was your friendships.\n\n- Yeah, I know, I got it.\n\nOh.\n\nSorry.\n\nStill not sharp.\n\nKept most of it the same.\n\nEven made myself a office nearby.\n\nJason, I-I [SIGHS]\n\nKind of took a wild guess.\n\nI finally get to accomplish my goal of living in a Stupid Nick's!\n\nI know anything you do for eternity gets boring, but I swear I will never get sick of wings!\n\nWell, I'll see you all tomorrow.\n\nAnd every tomorrow after that.\n\nYou know, Michael, at the end of the day, you were right.\n\n[HOPEFUL MUSIC]\n\nEverything is fine.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is what we've been looking for since the day we met.\n\nTime.\n\nI think that's what the Good Place really is.\n\nIt's not even a place, really, it's just having enough time with the people you love.\n\nYou're right.\n\nAnd we have as long as we want.\n\nIf you keep hogging this blanket, I'm probably gonna walk through that door in, like, three days, so [LAUGHS]\n\n[BLISSFUL MUSIC]\n\n- I'll miss you.\n\n- [LAUGHS]\n    ]"},{number:13,title:"Whenever You're Ready",summary:"Eleanor

think it says is that mortality offers meaning to the events of our lives.\n\nUh, check yourself, rando.\n\nI think Chidi Anagonye, who literally designed the afterlife, knows what he's talking about.\n\nLook, I'm pretty sure I'm right, since it's, like, my book.\n\n\n\nYes, Professor May, you're probably right about what you wrote.\n\n[LAUGHS, SNORTS]\n\nStill think he should check

architects and actors.\n\nWell, sorry, but these younger demon actors have no dedication to their craft.\n\nThey think they can just start acting.\n\nThey have to learn that acting is reacting, and reacting is pre-acting, but pre-acting, well, that's just being.\n\nOkay, take it down a notch, Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\n- Shawn, what you got?\n\n- Well, I'll begin by saying that this new system stinks,

it's working.\n\nCome on, admit it.\n\nI will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever,

the same as the air outside my body.\n\nIt was peaceful.\n\nYou know the feeling when you think a jalape\xc3\xb1o popper is gonna be too hot, but you bite into it anyway and it's actually the perfect

in love with someone else, I'm fine with that.\n\nLike, if Jason Momoa or if Lara Croft Tomb Raider gets in, and Janet's like, \"That's what's up,\" totally cool, but her forgetting me would be sad,

even when you're married to Aquaman, and I lost it somewhere in this forest.\n\nSome magical squirrel probably ate it.\n\nJason, it's okay.\n\nI'm never gonna forget you.\n\nIn fact, to me, you won't even really be gone.\n\nI don't experience time the same way you do.\n\nI kind of live all times at once.\n\nI know what you mean.\n\nOnce, I smoked salvia, and saw the past and the future at the same time.\n\nThen I tried to brush my teeth with my cat.\n\nTo me, remembering moments with you is the same as living in them.\n\nCan you just remember the happy times and forget the bad stuff?\n\nThere was no bad stuff.\n\nIt was all good.\n\nWow.\n\nThese spindles are gorgeous.\n\nAnd there's almost a feeling of musculature to this transition.\n\nThe oak just sort of told me the shape before I even got to the spoke shave.\n\nThis under-bevel is a great trick.\n\nIt really makes it feel lighter while leaving you plenty of beef to carve.\n\nIt's really just a modified Danish line.\n\nStill, you

go.\n\nAw, nuts.\n\nI knew it.\n\n- You finished everything on your list?\n\n- I did.\n\nI learned how to install a bathtub, fly a helicopter, defuse a b*mb, deliver the perfect backhand slice.\n\nMy last goal was to spend one meaningful day with my parents, and now I've spent thousands of them.\n\nI feel complete.\n\nWould you like me to prepare a farewell party for you?\n\nNo need.\n\nI've done it myself.\n\nI've cooked all the food, mixed all the drinks, made all the furniture, repainted all the walls, and trained all the animals.\n\nChampagne?\n\nUh, sure.\n\nThank you, panda.\n\nAlso, I've already said good-bye to everyone else in my life.\n\nMy sister, my parents, B and J.\n\nThey took it very hard.\n\nTonight, it's just us.\n\n[CLASSICAL MUSIC]\n\nI hate to tell you this, but

tell you something?\n\nYou're my role model.\n\n[SNORTS]\n\nCome on.\n\n- I'm serious.\n\n- Babe, you were already the most impressive person I ever met, and now you can do literally everything.\n\nIf that's true, it's because you inspired me.\n\nI admire you so very much.\n\nYour strength, your toughness, your self-esteem, not to mention you have a rocking bod.\n\nDid you just turn the tables on

Bye, love!\n\n- Bye!\n\nI admire your breadth of knowledge.\n\nI can only do one thing: be an architect.\n\nI've spent the last 500 Bearimies trying to learn how to play the\xa0\xa0guitar, and I just mastered \"Hey There Delilah.\n\n\" Don't sell yourself short, Michael.\n\nI dare say you're the greatest architect in existence, and I should know.\n\nALL: Frank Gehry is my godfather.\n\nFair enough.\n\nI deserved that.\n\n[LAUGHING]\n\nOh, Tahani, I'm gonna miss you, babe.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nWait.\n\nI don't want to leave.\n\nGreat!\n\nThen stay.\n\nNew party, everyone.\n\n- A staying party.\n\n- Whoo!\n\nNo.\n\nI-I also don't want to stay.\n\nI'm done here, but I don't want to go there.\n\nIt's kind of your only options.\n\nNo, they aren't.\n\nI want to learn to do what you do, Michael.\n\nI want to be an architect.\n\nDesign afterlives.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nTahani, you're a wonderful person, but you're a person.\n\nIt's impossible.\n\nNonsense!\n\nI can learn.\n\nJust like I learned all this other stuff.\n\nI've spent most of my life pretending to help people.\n\nIf I were an architect, I could do it for real.\n\nLet me at least try.\n\nDon't make me talk to your manager.\n\n- Oh!\n\n- BOTH: Ooh!\n\n- That's my girl!\n\n- Oh.\n\nHey, Jeff.\n\nBoy, kind of getting away from you here, huh?\n\nYeah.\n\nI love frogs though, so it's awesome.\n\nI did bring you one.\n\nOh, thanks, Tahani.\n\nJust toss it on the pile.\n\nHang on, hang on.\n\nSo, you can never tell a woman to smile?\n\nWhat if she'd legitimately be prettier if she smiled?\n\n- - Aren't I helping her?\n\nGlenn, Beadie, this is your new intern, Tahani.\n\nTahani!\n\nThis is so neat.\n\nI haven't seen you since I was exploded into goo.\n\nI didn't get any me on you, did I?\n\nYou did, but it's all goo under the bridge.\n\nAnyway, I want to learn everything.\n\nI shall start at the bottom and earn my way up.\n\nTo wit, would anyone like a cup of antimatter?\n\nSure, I take mine with nondairy neutrinos.\n\nComing right up.\n\n[SIGHING]\n\nThank you, Michael, for everything.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nI brought you a little \"first day on the job\" present.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nOnce you're a big deal around here, I hope you don't mind if I brag about knowing you.\n\nName-dropping's a little gauche, Michael, but do as you must.\n\nHmm.\n\n\"Working out the terms of moral justification is an unending task.\n\n\" Boom!\n\nI did it!\n\nIt only took me 2,000 Bearimies, but I finally finished that book.\n\nHa-ha, sucker!\n\nReading you was an unending task, but I freaking did it!\n\n- Congrats, babe.\n\n- Thanks.\n\n- What are you reading?\n\n- \"The Da Vinci Code.\n\n\" - Really?\n\n- Yeah, after a thousand lifetimes of reading the most difficult writings in the world, I've acquired a new passion.\n\nGarbage books.\n\nHey, do you think I would've been a good symbologist, if that were a real job?\n\nYes, I do.\n\nYa very cute.\n\n- Come on.\n\nWe gotta go to dinner.\n\n- Oh.\n\nI cannot believe she learned to cook this well.\n\nWhen I first met Tahani on Earth, she was trying to shove jewelry into a vending machine.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nOkay, well, if she is an architect, then she should design my idea.\n\nA karaoke room that's also a tanning bed.\n\nOoh, yes, and, like, the harder you commit to the song, like, the tanner you get?\n\nI gotta say, I am so glad that going through the system did not totally change you two ding-dongs.\n\n- [BOTH GIGGLING]\n\n- Oh.\n\nFor dessert, we have to get the tiramisu.\n\nMan.\n\nChidi Anagonye just casually making choices.\n\nI never thought I'd live to see it.\n\nI mean, I guess I didn't.\n\n- Oh, that's right!\n\n- [LAUGHTER]\n\n'Cause we're all dead!\n\n[ALL CHEERING]\n\nThat was so fun.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, it's always fun to see them.\n\nEvery time we do it, it's fun.\n\nI had coffee with my mom the other day, and she says hi, but she also finally learned how to pronounce your mom's name.\n\nWhich is good.\n\nYeah, yeah, they were joking about that last time we saw them.\n\n- Mm.\n\n- Remember?\n\nOh, right.\n\nYeah.\n\nShakespeare went through the door.\n\n- Really?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Everyone's talking about it.\n\n- It's probably for the best.\n\nHis last 4,000 plays were not nearly as good as the ones he wrote on Earth.\n\nI mean, did you see \"The Tempest 2: Here We Blow Again?\" Woof.\n\n[BOTH LAUGH]\n\nYou mind if we go home?\n\nI'm tired.\n\nSure.\n\n- All right.\n\n- Okay.\n\n[SOLEMN MUSIC]\n\nUm I'm gonna get ready for bed.\n\nCool.\n\nI'm gonna take a little stroll.\n\n- I'll see you in a bit.\n\n- Okay.\n\nDude.\n\nOh, hey, perfect.\n\nAre these good lyrics?\n\nThe psychedelic stardust and moonbeam banana No, stop, that's terrible, and we got a problem.\n\nI think Chidi's gonna leave.\n\nReally?\n\nDid he say he was ready?\n\nHe didn't say exactly that, but he's getting close.\n\nI can tell.\n\nI need to do something to shake things up, you know?\n\nLight a spark.\n\nOh!\n\nJanet?\n\n- Hi there.\n\n- Hi.\n\nI think Chidi's almost ready to walk through the door, and I need to keep him here, so, um, can you make me a bed shaped like a giant highlighter and, like, a sexy edible valedictorian robe?\n\nNo, I think this calls for something spiritual.\n\nAh, okay, but if I do this right, my man's gonna be talking to God.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nWait, what do you mean?\n\nForgive me, Eleanor, but if Chidi's ready to go, it's time for him to go.\n\nAh, he didn't say that yet though.\n\nWe're in classic Chidi grey area.\n\nYou need to remind him of what's great about this place.\n\nOh, oh.\n\nRemember where he took us, like, the first month - when we were all together?\n\n- Oh, great idea.\n\nYes.\n\n- Janet, set the scene.\n\n- Okay.\n\nWould you like it restored to its original glory?\n\nNo.\n\nThe first time he went, he was in college.\n\nHave it look and feel exactly like it was that day when he fell in love with it.\n\nAlso, pack me the edible robe.\n\nThat might seal the deal.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou're all set.\n\nHey, guess what?\n\nSurprise trip.\n\nCome on.\n\nSurprise trip?\n\nNow?\n\nYeah.\n\nSpecial fun trip, just us two.\n\nLet's go.\n\nCan I change out of my pajamas first?\n\nLet the door do it!\n\nCome on!\n\n- Come on, come on, come on.\n\n- Okay, okay, okay.\n\n[UPBEAT MUSIC]\n\nOh.\n\nOh, man, Eleanor.\n\nRight?\n\nWe haven't been here in so long.\n\nAthens.\n\nMan, this city, it takes my breath away every time.\n\nTalk it out, bud.\n\nTell me everything you know about this place because, full disclosure, I didn't really listen the first time you told me.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nWell, I mean, that's the Acropolis.\n\nOh, and this is the Pnyx.\n\nThousands of Athenians would gather here and listen to people discuss their city and its laws from that stage right there.\n\nThis is literally where democracy started.\n\nWell, that's fine and dandy, but as you may know, I'm kind of a philosophy gal.\n\nWhere were the big brains hanging out?\n\nSocrates, Aristotle, Plato, Diogenes, they all gathered right here in the agora.\n\nIt was like the Avengers, but for super thinkers.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nOh, come on.\n\nYou brought me here.\n\nYou knew what was gonna happen.\n\nNo, I love that you're so happy.\n\nHey, let me ask you something.\n\nIs it weird that when I picture ancient Greeks, I make them really hot?\n\nLike, to me, Aristotle is basically John Stamos with a beard.\n\nHonestly, that's kind of how I picture him too.\n\nGood, same page.\n\nWhat's this called again?\n\nKoulouvi?\n\nKoulouri, and I lived on these when I was here.\n\nI like to picture young Chidi Anagonye here, reading, nerding out, treating himself to a koulouri, if he had an astute insight into Aristotelian virtue ethics.\n\nOh, that is accurate.\n\nThat is an accurate picture of 20-year-old me.\n\nThis was so special.\n\nThank you.\n\nShould we head home?\n\nNope, because we're not done yet.\n\nThere's more special trip.\n\n- Janet?\n\n- Hi there.\n\nYou enjoying your trip, Chidi?\n\nYes, we are, but it's not over yet.\n\nWe are ready to head to destination number two.\n\n- Remember?\n\n- Yes, of course.\n\nHead right this way.\n\nOh, man.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nParis.\n\nYes, Paris, obviously.\n\nMy favorite city.\n\nAnd you even picked the ideal weather.\n\nOvercast and chilly.\n\nPerfect for staying inside and reading.\n\nIs this what you were hinting to me?\n\nI was thinking Six Flags, but this is way better.\n\nI used to come to this caf\xc3\xa9 every day when I lived here.\n\nI tried to sit in a different seat each time so I could eventually say that I definitely sat in the exact same place as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Richard Wright, Brecht, James Baldwin.\n\nWell, we got all the time in the world now, baby.\n\nPut that booty in a seat warmed by history.\n\nEleanor, I know what you're doing.\n\nBeing the best eternal girlfriend ever?\n\nGuilty.\n\nLet's take a walk.\n\nSo, Eleanor, here it is.\n\nI love you, completely and utterly.\n\nOh, crap.\n\nBut I have to go.\n\nBut you don't though.\n\nYou don't have to go.\n\nYou don't have to leave me.\n\nI don't want to leave you.\n\nI'm just ready to leave.\n\nI have the same feeling that the others described, a kind of quietude in my soul.\n\nBut you just had it.\n\nWhat if those other dummies didn't wait long enough, and the feeling fades, and you get to spend another billion Bearimies in fake afterlife Europe with your kickass girlfriend?\n\nI didn't just have it.\n\nI've had it a long time.\n\nRemember that day we were with our parents?\n\nMy mom kissed you good-bye, and got lipstick on your cheek, and your mom rubbed it off.\n\nI don't know why that was it, but that was it.\n\nAnd I didn't want to tell you because because.\n\nNo, man, this can't be because Jason's gone, Tahani's off doing her thing, and I'm not ready to go, so if you leave, then I'm alone here.\n\nI was alone my whole life, and I told myself I like it that way, but I don't.\n\nI like being with you.\n\n[HEARTFELT MUSIC]\n\nOkay, I won't go.\n\n- Really?\n\n- Yeah, I won't go.\n\nThere's there is still plenty to do.\n\nI'll stay.\n\nWho's ready for Six Flags?\n\nOh, we're good.\n\nWe got it.\n\nHe's gonna stay.\n\nTurn into birds and fly to Notre Dame?\n\nStand at the top of the Eiffel Tower and throw water balloons onto imaginary tourists?\n\n- [BOTH LAUGH]\n\n- Whatever you want to do.\n\nOkay, well, let's freshen up, have dinner at some schmancy restaurant, order a million-dollar bottle of wine, even though it tastes exactly like cheap, stupid wine, and sit in a room at the George V and\xa0\xa0watch\xa0\"Real Housewives\" of whatever city they're doing that in now.\n\nLove it.\n\nI'm gonna walk around my old neighborhood.\n\nSee where I used to live.\n\nMeet you at the restaurant?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- All right.\n\nLet's see what's on the menu.\n\nLiterally anything you could possibly imagine.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat are you thinking?\n\n\"Working out the terms of moral justification is an unending task.\n\n\" That's what I was thinking about.\n\nThat sentence.\n\nYou want to eat that sentence for dinner?\n\nCan we eat words, 'cause I asked Janet about this and No, no, it's the last line of Scanlon's book.\n\n- Remember?\n\n- Ah.\n\nThe whole book is about how we should try to find rules other people can't reasonably reject, and then he ends it by saying, \"The search for how to find those rules will go on forever.\n\n\" I proposed a rule that Chidis shouldn't be allowed to leave because it would make Eleanors sad, and I could do this forever, zip you around the universe showing you cool stuff, and I'd still never find the justification for getting you to stay.\n\nBecause it's a selfish rule.\n\nI owe it to you to let you go.\n\n[SORROWFUL MUSIC]\n\nI was never good at being sad.\n\nPartly because my mom straight up told me not to be.\n\nBut this is sad, man.\n\nYou got a John Locke quote or piece of Kantian wisdom you can throw at me?\n\nThose guys were more focused on rules and regulations.\n\nFor spiritual stuff, you gotta turn to the East.\n\nI'll take anything you got.\n\nHit me.\n\nPicture a wave in the ocean.\n\nYou can see it, measure it, its height, the way the sunlight refracts when it passes through, and it's there, and you can see it, you know what it is.\n\nIt's a wave.\n\nAnd then it crashes on the shore, and it's gone.\n\nBut the water is still there.\n\nThe wave was just a a different way for the water to be for a little while.\n\nThat's one conception of death for a Buddhist.\n\nThe wave returns to the ocean, where it came from, and where it's supposed to be.\n\nNot bad, Buddhists.\n\nNot bad.\n\nNone of this is bad.\n\nI need you to do me one last favor.\n\nMm-hmm?\n\nSay good-bye to me now, and leave before I wake up.\n\nYou can sit on that bench as long as you'd like, and whenever you're ready, you just walk through.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nOh, dip!\n\nYou're back.\n\n- Jason?\n\n- Yeah!\n\nWhat but how why Funny story.\n\nRemember how I made you something, and I thought I lost it because it wasn't in my pocket?\n\n- Uh-huh?\n\n- Turns out it was in my other pocket!\n\n\n\nBy the time I found it, you were gone.\n\nI was just gonna leave it for you, but I was worried it would get eaten by that magic squirrel.\n\nSo, I decided to wait for you to come back.\n\nEvery so often, a different Janet came, but I knew it wasn't you.\n\nJason, it's been, like, a thousand Bearimies.\n\nI know, but I wanted to see you again.\n\nIt was actually pretty easy to wait.\n\nI sort of just sat quietly and let my mind drift away.\n\nThought about you, and the infinity of the universe.\n\nKind of like a monk.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n[PLAYFUL MUSIC]\n\nLooks good, not-a-girl.\n\nChidi, wait up!\n\nHey-oh!\n\nTime to go nuts, 'cause I brought donuts Huh, no one's here.\n\nsh**t.\n\nThat was gonna be a big laugh.\n\nHey, sweetie.\n\nDid you not get the message?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy, was the meeting cancelled?\n\nUh, yeah.\n\nForever.\n\nWe dissolved the council.\n\n- What?\n\n- We don't need it anymore.\n\nYour system's working perfectly.\n\nMillions of humans passing their tests, you know.\n\nOh, Vicky's really k*lling it on the training, so it's all good.\n\nWell [STUTTERS]\n\nAll right, well hang on, now.\n\nLook, how are we even sure that this is the right system?\n\nI mean, honestly, I think Shawn was right.\n\nThis whole thing sucks and we should start from scratch.\n\nRelax, worrywart.\n\nTake a load off.\n\nHuh?\n\nEnjoy yourself.\n\nYou know what I just discovered recently?\n\nPodcasts.\n\nThere's, like, a billion of them and they just keep coming.\n\n- Hmm.\n\n- Now scoot.\n\nI got a new Radiolab to listen to about how clams learn.\n\n- [BOTH CHUCKLE]\n\n- Pretty excited.\n\n[UPBEAT MUSIC]\n\n[VCR CLICKING]\n\nI love you.\n\nAnd you don't need to respond, 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel.\n\nI love you too.\n\nKnock, knock, knock.\n\nOh.\n\nHey, what's up?\n\nCan I talk to you for a sec?\n\nYeah, sure, why not?\n\n- Hey, Derek?\n\n- Yes, Mindy?\n\nWhat can Derek do for you?\n\nEleanor and I are gonna talk for a bit, so go into your nether sphere.\n\nThat's Derek?\n\nMindy has rebooted Derek more than 151 million times.\n\nDerek is now both a singular point in space, and yet, Derek also contains space itself.\n\nThe nexus of Derek is without dimension.\n\nThe moment of Derek's creation and the eventual heat death of the universe are now inexorably the same.\n\nUgh, you are so annoying!\n\n[WHOOSHES]\n\nWant a beer?\n\nSo that's how you spend your days?\n\nWandering around, searching for the thing that makes you complete?\n\nPretty much.\n\nI thought it was connected to my parents or my friends, but now I think it might be something else.\n\nI think it might be you.\n\nI think my final mission might be to convince you to go through the system.\n\nTake the test.\n\nYou know, when I first met you, I thought, \"Oof, \"well, there's a chick I understand.\n\nLone wolf, totally independent, knows what she wants.\n\n\" BOTH: Cocaine and self-pleasure.\n\nRight.\n\nBut I actually think you're a version of me if I'd never met my friends.\n\nYou're like the worst-case scenario of what I could have become.\n\n- No offense.\n\n- None taken.\n\nLook, the thing is, Eleanor, I am fine with where I am.\n\nSee, I don't think you are.\n\nOr at least, you could be better.\n\nIf we're cut from the same cloth, then trust me.\n\nThere is greater happiness waiting for you if you form bonds with other people, and I think you know that.\n\nYou told me about me and Chidi that time.\n\nYou showed me the tape.\n\nYou said you were rooting for us.\n\nI think you have the ability to care.\n\nI don't know.\n\nCaring just seems like - a lot of work.\n\n- Mm.\n\nAnd I have been on my own for so long.\n\nI can't imagine putting my fate in the hands of some stranger.\n\nI thought you might say that.\n\nHello, gorgeous.\n\nEleanor.\n\nAnd Mindy St.\n\nClaire, as I neither live nor breathe!\n\nWhat brings you ladies here?\n\nTrying to convince Mindy to enter the system after all this time.\n\nShe's a little worried about who might end up designing her test Say no more.\n\nI'm on the case.\n\nReally?\n\nAre you, like, certified or whatever?\n\nWell, not yet, but it won't be long, right, Shawn?\n\n- [OMINOUS MUSIC]\n\n- Oh, I think you'll find that Tahani will be certified very soon.\n\nDid that sound evil?\n\nI didn't mean it to.\n\nI was sincere.\n\nForce of habit.\n\nI do think you'll find that Tahani will be certified ve hmm.\n\nShut up, Glenn.\n\nGreat.\n\nSo, you go back to your old life, chill with your floating Derek head, when Tahani gets certified, you enter the system, Tahani designs your test.\n\nDeal?\n\nWhy not?\n\nSomething new.\n\n[CHUCKLES]\n\nThanks for giving a crap about me.\n\nI don't really give a crap about myself, so it's nice that someone does.\n\nI'm really glad I filmed you having sex.\n\nMe too.\n\nYou can sit on that bench as long as you want.\n\nWhenever you're ready, you just walk through.\n\nWell, good, 'cause I'm definitely ready.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nI'm not ready.\n\nDamn it, Janet.\n\nWhat the fork?\n\nI should be ready and I'm not.\n\nBut I am.\n\nMichael, what are you doing?\n\nI'm going through the door.\n\nThere's nothing left for me to do.\n\nI feel sated and complete.\n\nI'm not sure you're thinking this through, dude.\n\nYes, I am.\n\nA calm has washed over me.\n\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\nGood-bye.\n\nDid I go through the wrong way?\n\nWait, wait, just one minute.\n\nI know this is gonna look silly but it probably will work.\n\n[GRUNTING]\n\nMichael, what are you doing?\n\nI am returning my damn essence to the damn fabric of the damn universe.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, there we go.\n\nIt's working now.\n\nIt's working.\n\nI'm leaving.\n\nBye.\n\nIt's not working because you're looking.\n\n- Stop looking.\n\n- Michael, that door is not for you.\n\nWhy not?\n\nI invented the damn thing!\n\nYou know, this stinks.\n\nYou guys get to move on, but I am trapped here forever?\n\nHow's that fair?\n\nOh, I got it.\n\nEleanor, come here.\n\nYou go through and give me a piggyback.\n\n- We can trick it.\n\n- Ooh, no.\n\nOw!\n\n- Ow!\n\nOw!\n\nMichael, no!\n\n- Hold still well, hold Michael!\n\nAll right.\n\nCome with me.\n\n[SIGHS]\n\nFire squids are heavy.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Sorry.\n\nNew people are getting in all the time.\n\nTahani's still around.\n\nMaybe you team up with her, design some afterlife neighborhoods?\n\nI did that already, remember?\n\nSpent 50 Bearimies making new neighborhoods for new residents.\n\nWhen you've already designed the ultimate one, it's kind of a letdown.\n\nI've loved being here, but Jason's gone.\n\nChidi's gone.\n\nYou know, even Doug Forcett went through the door.\n\nThat was probably for the best.\n\nThat guy partied so hard when he was here.\n\nI guess I'll just stay here forever, you know?\n\nPutter around doing mundane things like some sad old retiree.\n\nMaybe I'll have Janet make me a hardware store so I can buy a hex wrench that I don't really need.\n\nCockamamie!\n\nThat's what I think of your plan.\n\nI think it's cockamamie.\n\nI think it's a great plan, and I bet deep down, you do too.\n\nIt sets a bad precedent.\n\nBabe, no one else is ever gonna want to do this.\n\nPlus, if they ask, you just say, \"Sure, pal, \"go save every soul in the universe, and then we got a deal.\n\n\" And think about it this way: If you do this, you'll never have to hear from any of us ever again.\n\nOoh.\n\nNow that sounds tempting.\n\n'Cause y'all are annoying.\n\nI mean, you did save the universe and all, but your tone.\n\n- It's your tone.\n\n- I know.\n\n[DOOR OPENS, WHOOSHES]\n\nMichael?\n\nCome on in.\n\n[BRIGHT MUSIC]\n\nAll my Earth stuff.\n\nOh, my old bowling ball.\n\nOh, hi, paper clips.\n\nWhat prompted all this?\n\nYou know, it took me a while to figure it out, but earlier, when you were walking back and forth through the door, it hit me.\n\nYou will never be at peace until you get the one thing you truly want.\n\nI'm I'm gonna be A real boy, Pinocchio.\n\nThe Judge gave me the power to make you an actual human.\n\nGood-bye, fire squid.\n\nHello, silver fox.\n\nOh, Eleanor!\n\nOh, my goodness!\n\nNow, you need to be sure about this.\n\nYou're gonna live down there for, like some amount of time, you'll die, really die, then you'll enter an afterlife test, be judged on what you did, the whole deal.\n\nAt least so we think.\n\nWhile you're down there, this entire system could be changed.\n\nShawn might launch a coup.\n\nSomeone could design a whole new system.\n\nYou won't really know what's going to happen to you.\n\nThat's what makes it special.\n\nI won't exactly know what's going to happen after I die.\n\nNothing more human than that.\n\nBesides texting people that you're five minutes away when you haven't even left the house.\n\nThank you, Eleanor.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nHey, Mike.\n\nWhere you headed today?\n\n- Earth, actually.\n\n- Oh.\n\nBeen a while.\n\nHere's the return clicker.\n\nNo need.\n\nOne-way trip.\n\nWow.\n\nOkay.\n\nGood luck.\n\nThank you.\n\nI have something for you.\n\nYeah?\n\n- He's real!\n\n- [LAUGHS]\n\nIt's real!\n\nHe's a real frog!\n\n- Yes, it sure is.\n\n- [BOTH

here's your driver's license and your Social Security card.\n\nI set up a bank account for you.\n\nThere's enough money in there so that you don't starve, but not so much that you become an entitled jerk.\n\nThank you, Janet.\n\nMake a doctor's appointment as soon as you get down there.\n\nAnd no salty food.\n\nYou have to keep your blood pressure down.\n\nYou have blood now.\n\nI'll be fine.\n\nI'll be okay.\n\nI know.\n\nI just worry.\n\n[HEARTFELT MUSIC]\n\nI'll see you again, you know.\n\nI'll see you when I get back.\n\n[VOICE BREAKING]\n\nOkay.\n\nIf you rent a car, don't pay for the insurance.\n\nIt's a scam.\n\nOkay.\n\n[SIRENS WAILING DISTANTLY]\n\nMan, it's hot.\n\nBut it's a it's a dry heat.\n\nSo, as I mentioned before, you can sit on this bench as long as you want, and whenever you're ready, you just walk through.\n\nCare to join me for a bit?\n\n[RELAXED MUSIC]\n\nMargarita?\n\nAlways.\n\n- [LAUGHS]\n\n- Mmm.\n\nOkay, top three moments of your not-life with us.\n\nGo.\n\nYou telling us that we should try to help other people on Earth, the moment that we all got into the Good Place for real, and then it's an 8-million-way tie of every time Jason and I kissed.\n\n- He was a really good kisser.\n\n- I bet he was.\n\nI wonder how Michael's doing.\n\nI assume he's doing the same as every human.\n\n- ALL: Three, two, one - Some good days.\n\nALL: Happy New Year!\n\nSome bad days.\n\nShe's gonna be okay.\n\nThis city has really good hospitals.\n\nHe's got a few friends.\n\nSuch a good boy, Jason.\n\nSuch a good boy.\n\n[CELL PHONE BUZZING]\n\nA few people he can't stand.\n\n[GRUMBLES]\n\nHe's learning some things - all by himself.\n\n- Oh, geez, ow!\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nAnd hopefully learning to ask for help when he needs it.\n\nGuitar like this.\n\nFingers this way.\n\n[STRUMS A CHORD]\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nYou have no idea how long I've been trying to figure that out.\n\nWell, everybody needs a teacher.\n\nSo do it again.\n\nHe's messing up, and trying again, and messing up again, and then getting things wrong, and then trying to make them right.\n\nThat's what everyone does.\n\n- To Michael.\n\n- To Michael.\n\nWhat do you think happens when people walk through the door?\n\nIt's the only thing in the universe I don't know.\n\nI don't know either.\n\nThe wave returns to the ocean.\n\nWhat the ocean does with the water after that is
